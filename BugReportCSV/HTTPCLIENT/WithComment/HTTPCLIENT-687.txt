DefaultRedirectHandler does not access correct HttpParams
In the getLocationURI HttpResponse HttpContext method the HttpParams for determining REJECT RELATIVE REDIRECT and ALLOW CIRCULAR REDIRECTS are retrieved with HttpParams params response.getParams The response HttpParams do not contain these values however the request HttpParams do. The correct implementation is HttpRequest request HttpRequest context.getAttribute HttpExecutionContext.HTTP REQUEST HttpParams params request.getParams Actually response was supposed to inherit link to the request parameters. Anyways it is still a bug. It is nice to know people are experimenting with HttpClient 4.0. OlegFixed in SVN trunk. Oleg
