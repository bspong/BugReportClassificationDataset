HttpConnection.isOpen logging is not accurate
isOpen does not differentiate between stale and closed. If the connection is closed isStale will return true. The logs will then indicate that the connection was stale even though it was really just closed. close is also called a second time unnecessarily. This should be fixed for 3.0 and perhaps even 2.0.1. http nagoya.apache.org eyebrowse ReadMsg listName commons-httpclient- dev jakarta.apache.org msgNo 7205 Created an attachment id 11704 Patch 1 This should fix the problem. I will apply this patch to 2.0 and HEAD if there are no objections. MikeLooks good to me OlegPatch applied to 2.0 and HEAD. Mike
