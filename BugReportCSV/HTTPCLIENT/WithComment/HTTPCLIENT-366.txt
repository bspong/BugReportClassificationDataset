PostMethod Java doc refers to wrong section of RFC1945
 The HTTP POST method is defined in section 9.5 of RFC1945 should read The HTTP POST method is defined in section 8.3 of RFC1945 Change 9.5 to 8.3.Fix applied to 2.0 and HEAD. Thanks for the tip Sean. MikeFolks Sorry for this confusion. The reference points used to point to the correct section. However the RFC number was not correct. RFC 1945 defines version 1.0 of the HTTP spec. It has been superseded by RFC 2616 that defines version 1.1 of the HTTP spec. The reference should read The HTTP POST method is defined in section 9.5 of a href http www.ietf.org rfc rfc2616.txt RFC2616 a OlegFix applied to 2.0 and HEAD. Oleg
