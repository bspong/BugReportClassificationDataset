questionable default value for BufferedOutputStream size in HttpConnection
From the dev list Hi Eric Thanks for bringing this up. HttpClient 3.0 allows for parameterization of SO SNDBUF and SO RCVBUF settings. For HttpClient 2.0 as well as for 3.0 when falling back onto the system defaults however it would make sense to set a cap on the size of the send and receive buffers. Feel free to open a ticket for this issue with Bugzilla Oleg On Fri 2004-07-02 at 18 39 Eric Bloch wrote Hi httpclient folks I ve been looking at 2.0 source code and the default value for the BufferedOutputStream that is used in an HttpConnectionn is coming from socket.getSendBufferSize . My hunch is that in general this is bigger than you d want. Most HTTP sends are less than 1KByte cept for big POSTs . The default value I get for socket.getSendBufferSize for this is 8192. I would think a better default for this buffer would be 1K no Also fyi if someone happens to dork the system send buffer size hi say MB and you are using the MultiThreadedConnectionManager in 2.0 dunno about 3.0 you will use up a lot of memory for each connection since the pool doesn t let idle connections or their buffers be gced. I just got bit bad by that. -Eric Created an attachment id 12128 Patch against 2.0 branch The fix is pretty straightforward. If do not hear any objections within a couple of days I ll apply the patch as is OlegThis seems applicable to 3.0 too.Looks ok. Is there a reason you chose 2K in particular I see no real problem with it it just seems arbitrary. MikeNo particular reason. Completely arbitraty indeed. What would be a more approriate value Oleg2K is fine with me. Just thought I d check. MikePatch committed to CVS HEAD and 2.0 branch Oleg
