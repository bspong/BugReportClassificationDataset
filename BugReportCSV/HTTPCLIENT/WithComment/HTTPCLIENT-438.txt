commons codec not documented as a dependency
Except for some entries on the jdepend-report commons codec is not documented as a dependency for using HttpClient 3.0 RC1. The only dependency documented is commons logging. java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError org apache commons codec DecoderException at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase. init HttpMethodBase.java 217 at org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods.ExpectContinueMethod. init ExpectContinueMethod.java 92 at org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods.EntityEnclosingMethod. init EntityEnclosingMethod.java 114 at org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods.PostMethod. init PostMethod.java 105 Bullshit. Look at http jakarta.apache.org commons httpclient 3.0 dependencies.htmlThere s no call to be rude. That s great that there s a dependency page hidden under Project Info along with mailing lists cvs access and other infrastructure pages. Unfortunately I missed that page. However I came across this page right off User Guide - Tutorial http jakarta.apache.org commons httpclient 3.0 tutorial.html The first thing you need to do is get a copy of HttpClient and it s dependencies. Currently the only required dependency is commons-logging. And yes I know it says it s for 2.0 but obviously-misleading information should be fixed especially when filed under 3.0 tutorial.html Having a Dependencies section in the User Guide and it can be nothing more than a link to the Dependencies page would make life easier for us end-users. Maurice We use Maven to generate the website. For this reason the dependencies page is where it is. And it s the same for most Maven enabled projects. Also because we use Maven dependency information on that page is always accurate and bug reports like this one should never occur. Thanks for the pointer to the tutorial however. We will sort this out ASAP.Tutorial changed and site redeployed.Reopening. docs BUILDING.txt also needs to be changed or removed .docs BUILDING.txt and docs TESTING.txt removed from the SVN trunk as no longer up to date Oleg
