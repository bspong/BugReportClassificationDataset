Plug-in authentication modules
Currently only basic authentication is supported. A Authentication interface should be provided to allow for plug-in support for other authenticaiton schemes some of which may be application specific and therefore have no place in httpclient itself but would be required by some users.Plug-in mechanism for authentication schemes has been implemented in CVS HEAD
