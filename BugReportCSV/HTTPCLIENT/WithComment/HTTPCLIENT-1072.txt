Inline nested jars in OSGi bundles
Eclipse doesn t support bundles with nested jars https bugs.eclipse.org bugs show bug.cgi id 111238 . The workaround is to inline the contents of the nested jars. This is a simple fix that shouldn t impact non-Eclipse users pom.xml - Embed-Dependency scope compile runtime inline false Embed-Dependency Embed-Dependency scope compile runtime inline true Embed-Dependency Workaround committed to the SVN trunk and the 4.1.x branch. Sorry it took so long. Oleg
