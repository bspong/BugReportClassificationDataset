Allow access to registered cookie policies
It would be useful for JMeter and perhaps other applications to have access to the list of registered Cookie policy names. If this is acceptable let me know if you want me to provide a patch. Go for it OlegPatch to 3.0 branch. Returns array of all registered names except DEFAULTHi Sebastian We can avoid the creation of some temporary objects by changing your patch as follows - create the ArrayList with appropriate size SPECS.size in case there is no DEFAULT - create the array for the toArray call with appropriate size list.size Would you mind adding a description to the JavaDocs for the overview pages Obtains the registered cookie policy names. or something like that. I m not sure whether it s worth the trouble to strip the DEFAULT policy from the result.   return String SPECS.keySet .toArray new String SPECS.size looks so much simpler. And you can check whether the default policy is registered. It should be but it can be deregistered. cheers   Roland JavaDoc - OK I just followed the lead of getCompatibilitySpec but I see that is deprecated Size - OK Removing DEFAULT I ve added an option to include it or notOriginal patch can be deleteted marked as obsolete not sure how to do that Hi Sebastian there s still the new String 0 instead of new String list.size - I think the boolean argument to this method is overkill. We should just agree on one behavior and implement that. I don t have strong feelings about it so if you prefer to remove the default go with it. But you should be aware that a custom cookie spec might be registered only as the default and not with an explicit name. cheers   Roland OK had no realised that the default was not always the same as one of the other entries. Patch updated accordingly. I added since 3.1 as well - hope that s OK. Obsoletes patch.txt and patch1.txt.Patch checked in. Many thanks Sebastian Oleg
