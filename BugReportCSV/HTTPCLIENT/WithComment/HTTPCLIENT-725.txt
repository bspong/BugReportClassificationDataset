TSCCM code cleanup
The ThreadSafeClientConnectionManager or rather it s ConnPoolByRoute needs plenty of cleanup. - use long TimeUnit for timeout intervals Java 5 style - compute timeout end date once instead of remaining interval - review which methods should acquire the pool lock   and which should expect the caller to have done that - use factory methods to instantiate some of the helper objects most items taken care of only the locking review is pendingI ll leave the locking as it is for now. cheers   Roland
