Redefine HttpClient vs HttpMultiClient interface for 2.0
In particular the HttpClient HttpMultiClient issue must be resolved. HttpultiClient functionality should be prefered but HttpClient is the most suitable name. Consider impact to other projects. Is java1.1 compatability really an issue anymore No need for java1.1. Prefer the HttpClient name.HttpClient is the standard client class from version 1.0. HttpMultiClient was added in 2.0alpha1 to address the lack of synchronization in the old client and provide the core for a multi-threaded http based application. The problem is that we have 2 different client classes that although they do pretty much the same thing their interfaces are quite different due to the single session nature of HttpClient and the multiple connection pool HttpMultiClient. Here are 4 proposed requirements for this feature. 1 The top level class should be HttpClient 2 HttpMultiClient has the functionality we should present in the top level class 3 HttpMultiClient has not been in a release other than alpha so it should be safe to remove as an interface 4 Backwards compatability with HttpClient1.0 interface should be maintained as much as possible with deprication where it makes sense. HTTPCLIENT-65 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. Created an attachment id 3910 preliminary merge of HttpClient and HttpMultiClient Merged. Thanks a bundle Mike
