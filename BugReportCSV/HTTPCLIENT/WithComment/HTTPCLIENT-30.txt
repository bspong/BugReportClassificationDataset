should allow receiving secure cookies from non-secure chanel
Currently httpclient will throw an exception if a secure cookie is received from a non-secure chanel. Although RFC doesn t specify explicitly on if the client should allow receiving secure cookie from non-secure channel the default setting in browser seems to allow it. Try the following link in IE http www.snapfish.com The default cookie policy in httpclient should be the same.RFC 2109 does not prohibit receiving secure cookies over and insecure channel See section 4.2.2 . Thus HttpClient should not throw an an exception in this case. The specification does gives us the client the leeway to decided when we will send secure cookies back to the origin server. HttpClient will sill only add secure cookies to a Cookie header if the connection is secure.
