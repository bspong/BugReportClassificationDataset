stackable parameters
Implement stackable parameters to allow for a parameter hierarchy without linking params instances.I ve created a class o.a.h.impl.client.ClientParamsStack and changed DefaultClientRequestDirector to use that instead of HttpParamsLinker. The calls to HPLinker are still in the source code as comments so you can easily locate the changes. The next step would be to move the stack-building from the director to the client and to drop the params attribute from the director. The director should take it s parameters from the stack that comes with the request. I ll wait with that until the first step is reviewed. cheers   Roland Looks good to me. OlegI ve slightly revised my plan for the next step. Parameter stack building is moved to AbstractHttpClient but the DefaultClientRequestDirector keeps it s params attribute and constructor argument. Instead of the plain client parameters it is initialized with the params stack created by the client. On first glance it seems to me that the behavior of the director becomes more predictable this way. It doesn t switch between using client-only params and the params stack created for the request. cheers   Roland
