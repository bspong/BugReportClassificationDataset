FormBodyPart code does not agree with ContentDescriptor Javadoc wrt nullability of mimeType and transferEncoding
The FormBodyPart does not agree with ContentDescriptor Javadoc wrt nullability of mimeType and transferEncoding The code in FormBodyPart explicitly allows mimeType and transferEncoding to be null in which case the relevant header is not generated. This is useful behaviour as the headers are not necessaruly needed. However the bahaviour disagrees with the Javadoc in the ContentDescriptor interface - null is not allowed. Also AbstractContentBody does not allow mime-type to be null.ContentDescriptor was copied from mime4j and its javadocs are wrong with regards to nullability of mimeType and transferEncoding. OlegI took a closer look at the classes that implement ContentDescriptor and they all return non-null values for mimeType and transferEncoding. I was wrong about javadocs being wrong. FormBodyPart is simply coded defensively. I do not think we have any problem at all. Feel free to change FormBodyPart or re-phrase javadocs of ContentDescriptor if you deem it necessary.
