Please add maven-notice-plugin to gump-trunk
Hi the httpclient build currently fails in Gump because it cannot find the maven-notice-plugin. We could grab it from http svn.apache.org repos asf httpcomponents maven-notice-plugin trunk but since you have a directory with externals just for Gump it would be a lot easier if you added an external for it as well. Thanks StefanHi Stefan Currently all builds of HttpClient are broken due to my mistake. We are not really in business of developing maven plugins. There should be no development activity for the notice plugin once it does what it is meant to do. I think the simplest solution to the problem is reverting back to the non-snapshot release of the plugin until 0.0.2 is released. OlegIf you can live with the released version sure that would be fine. Thank you for sharing the background.Both Core and Client trunks now depend on LICENSE and NOTICE plugin version 0.0.2 Oleg
