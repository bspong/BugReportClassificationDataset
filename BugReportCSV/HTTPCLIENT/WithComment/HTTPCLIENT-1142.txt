Infinite loop on NTLM authentication
I got an infinite loop on NTLM authentication if the authentication failed bad credentials . The state FAILED of the NTLM sheme is never catched in the method authenticate of the class HttpAuthenticator line 123 . I fix temporatily this bug by adding a case for the protocol state HANDSHAKE.Could you please attach a wire context log of the failing session 1 as well as your patch Oleg 1 http hc.apache.org httpcomponents-client-dev logging.htmlFind in attachment the logs I have. You can see that I entered in an infinite loop. I just added this line before the line 116 case HANDSHAKE It execute the same code than UNCHALLENGED case. I don t know if it is the best solution ... but it works for meThe fix looks reasonable. Committed to SVN trunk. It is really a shame 4.2a1 got shipped with such a silly one-liner bug. Oleg
