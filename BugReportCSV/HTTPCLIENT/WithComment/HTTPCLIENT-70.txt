Provide more Example Code
- better project samples showing how to use HttpClient in a variety of ways. There is already a src examples directory which is excellent. Its in the right place and should be build with a full compile if only to know how any API changes may effect example code and that we will be required to keep them current. - make sure it uses the 2.0 API and no depricated methods There has been a steady flow of examples added to the repository. There is enough there now but more examples are always welcome. The examples are currently not being build with a normal build. This should be done next to ensure the examples stay up to date.There has been a steady flow of examples added to the repository. There is enough there now but more examples are always welcome.

No graphical client no swing libraries just a simple connect get the page submit the page get the result.Requested sample has been added http cvs.apache.org viewcvs jakarta-commons httpclient src examples FormLoginDemo.java OlegPatch committed
