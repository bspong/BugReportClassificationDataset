Customizable Cookie Policy
Even if the server is not complying with the cookie specification sometimes you still need to talk to it. It would be nice that when setting the Cookie Policy for the HttpMethod you could specify a custom policy that implements the CookieSpecBase but may handle certain problems more leniently. This would be instead of specifying one of the three hard-coded policies.We do plan to provide a plug-in mechanism for custom cookie policies in post-2.0 releases. This feature has been on our to-do list for quite some time Oleg Created an attachment id 8618 Patch take 1 The patch extends CookiePolicy class with a custom cookie specification plug-in mechanism. Let me know what you think. OlegOleg This looks good. Nice work. I have only two minor comments Ê- CookiePolicy.getSpecByVersion int should be deprecated I think. Ê- All of the static methods in CookiePolicy should be grouped together. Preferably after the static params I think. Mike - CookiePolicy.getSpecByVersion int should be deprecated I think. I was not sure if I should deprecate this one as it arguably could still be useful. But because this method is not flexible enough one cannot change cookie specs associated with cookie versions I agree it should be deprecated - All of the static methods in CookiePolicy should be grouped together. I ll do so. OlegCreated an attachment id 8623 Patch take 2 Patch committed. Oleg
