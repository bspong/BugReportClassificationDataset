Add OSGi bundle metadata to manifest
See this discussion on the Felix mailing list http www.mail-archive.com felix-dev incubator.apache.org msg04041.html If there is an easy way to generate the information required for an OSGi bundle into the manifest of our distributable JAR we should do it. The runtime and API are not affected it is only a modification of the build process. I ll follow up on this when I have information about the required tooling. cheers   Roland Not with 3.x. The code base is not suited to be run as a shared library and we should not encourage that. Besides the Maven plugin 1 that generates the meta information is a Maven 2 plugin. It relies on a Java tool that is ASL licensed. Enrique thanks for the information. 2 HttpComponents - all of them - should make use of that plugin and ship as OSGi bundles. We ll have to document how to run the code safely as a shared library. In particular bundled applications need to shut down connection managers and or NIO reactors on unload. Shared resources like SchemeRegistry.DEFAULT must not be modified and should not be used at all. I ll try to take care of this later this year. I need to learn Maven anyway. cheers   Roland 1 http cwiki.apache.org FELIX bundle-plugin-for-maven-bnd.html 2 http www.mail-archive.com felix-dev incubator.apache.org msg04056.html There is now an official OSGi bundle for HttpClient 4.0 Oleg
