PostMethod - Chunked requests are not supported at the moment.
For Apache Axis we d like send a POST request without needing to calculate the content-length for HTTP 1.1 based servers. Of course if the server-side does not support 1.1 then a fallback mechanism could calculate the total size under the covers. Also see related request from Trevor O Reilly wtrevor yahoo.com http marc.theaimsgroup.com l jakarta-commons-user m 102719653201792 w 2HttpClient does support chunking requests and responses on the respective output input streams. Chunking requests can be set when using the HttpConnection method code public OutputStream getRequestOutputStream boolean useChunking code The PutMethod does allow for chunking with the funky call code conn.getRequestOutputStream isHttp11 null getRequestHeader Content-Length code and then writes to the output stream. But the PostMethod just calls con.write directly so the chunking code in the stream is bypassed. This seems like a reasonable request to do in the 2.0 timeframe. Support for chunk encoded requests in all entity enclosing methods has been implemented
