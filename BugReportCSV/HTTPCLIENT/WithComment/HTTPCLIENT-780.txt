ProxyHost HttpHost Checks for null when javadoc document null ok
The constructor javadocs for ProxyHost and HttpHost all state that null is an allowed value - but there s an check in the HttpHost constructor for this which throws IllegalArgumentException. Actually allowing null as documented would also allow for a spring wiring remaining the same when using a proxy or not - steering the values from a propertyfile. David I fixed javadocs in the SVN trunk but it is very unlikely there is going to be another public release of the 3.x codeline. Oleg
