cache does not honor must-revalidate or proxy-revalidate Cache-Control directives
http www.w3.org Protocols rfc2616 rfc2616-sec14.html sec14.9.4 There are a couple of missed requirements here regarding must-revalidate and proxy-revalidate which applies only to shared caches . 1. When a cache entry with this directive is revalidated it must be an end-to-end revalidation meaning it must include max-age 0 on the request . 2. If the revalidation with the origin fails the cache MUST NOT return a stale entry and MUST return a 504 response. The provided patch fixes this issue by adding max-age 0 to revalidations for these directives and generating a 504 if there is an IOException when attempting to revalidate a stale entry. There is a related issue https issues.apache.org jira browse HTTPCLIENT-962 where it is not currently clear if the cache is a shared cache or not. The conservative assumption here is that we are a shared cache and hence must-revalidate and proxy-revalidate are essentially the same. However the unit tests for proxy-revalidate in TestProtocolRequirements are conditional on whether the CachingHttpClient claims to be a shared cache or not. This patch is contributed to the ASF with the permission of my employer. Patch checked in. Many thanks Jon Oleg
