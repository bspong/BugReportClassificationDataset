New PostSOAP example for src examples 
I have a slightly modified version of PostXML which invokes SOAP requests. The only difference to PostXML is that PostSOAP takes the SOAPAction as an extra commndline arg and adds that as a header into the request.Created an attachment id 17246 PostSOAP example java src file usage java PostSOAP url soapaction soaprequest xml file The question which I think needs to be answered is whether separate PostXML and PostSOAP examples are desirable. I could change PostSOAP to support both sets of functionality using an optional parameter e.g. -soapaction soapaction . If the soapaction argument is missing it would behave the same as PostXML. The example would have a little bit more logic which isn t necessarily a good thing for an example but it would remove the duplication of code between the two files as there would then only be one . If people prefer we could keep the name PostXML even though it supported SOAP as well.Paul It s easy to support both Move the SOAP action to the end of the parameter list and make it optional. We can just replace the PostXML with PostSOAP. The extra header won t hurt either if the URL is not a web service endpoint. OdiAdded to the SVN trunk with some minor tweaks Oleg
