Connection not closed after Connection close request
In HTTP specification at http www.w3.org Protocols rfc2616 rfc2616- sec8.html under chapter Negotiation it is stated If either the client or the server sends the close token in the Connection header that request becomes the last one for the connection. HttpClient v2.0.2 and v3.0 alpha2 is currently closing connection only if server has sent Connection close header and not when request contains it.Created an attachment id 13790 Patch take 1 Please let me know what you think.
