Add support for Digest authentication to the Authenticator class
Here s some code initially whipped up by Geza for Apache Axis now adapted to HTTPClient that adds support for Digest authentication to the Authenticator class. I have tested this code against tomcat 4.0.4 with a sample code that calls an Apache Axis Web Service. One caveat according to Geza the code Right now does not support qop-int .Created an attachment id 2358 Patch that adds support for Digest authentication HTTPCLIENT-55 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. The current patch is good. The only problem is that it breaks one of the test cases a test case that is broken correctly as it trivally tests for the Digest authentication to fail . Please provide test cases to TestAuthenticator.java to support this patch. Created an attachment id 2361 Additional tests for Digest Authentication. against latest cvs . Patches applied. Closing this bug as the feature has been added with unit tests.
