 API Doc Document exceptions thrown on execute methods
There should be more detailed documentation on HttpClient executeMethod and HttpMethod execute about exceptions thrown in which cases.In order to avoid unnecessary overlap in efforts I want to inform you that I started working on this one. sighing OlegCreated an attachment id 12165 exception handling guide take 1 Folks Here s the first draft version of the exception handling guide. Please let me know how it is shaping up. OlegWow Oleg Nice work. This is quite a thorough addition. I read it mostly for content and it looks quite good. There were a few minor grammatical problems which we can fix once it s checked in. The only error I noticed was a typo in the ProtocolException section where HttpException was accidentally used at the beginning of the paragraph. Content-wise the only part that stuck out to me was the inclusion of the many exceptions that users will never see. It s nice that they re documented but being that it s a user guide I think it may confuse people. If we could separate the non-user exceptions somehow that would be good. A separate section may be enough. MikeMike I am glad that several week of self-inflicted misery seem to have resulted in something useful. I think it now would make more sense if you took it over from me. Feel free to rearrange things to your liking and make corrections that you deem necessary. Meanwhile I concentrate on drafting up the remaining documentation Do you think that would be OK with you OlegSounds like a plan. I ll make some edits and commit the docs. MikeWell after much delay this has finally been edited and committed. Nice work on this Oleg Mike
