Standardize on a common mocking framework either EasyMock or Mockito 
We are currently using EasyMock in the caching module and Mockito in the main module. While Mockito appears to have a somewhat nicer API the sheer number of test cases based on EasyMock in the caching module makes it much simpler to replace Mockito with EasyMock than the other way around.I was only able to find one use of Mockito in the whole project and at that in just one test file... Did I miss something Attached please find the patch converting that one test case to use EasyMock. My Company Comcast has authorized me to submit this patch to you and grants all license to the Apache Foundation.Patch changing Mockito to EasyMock.I struggled somewhat with EasyMock and found Mockito slightly cleaner and more expressive. That is why I was not sure which one to keep. EasyMock it is. OlegPatch checked in. Many thanks JoeYeah - As I was doing the conversion I noted that they are syntactically only slight variations of one another. They also follow slightly different mocking philosophy Mockito by default seems to create a Nice mock EasyMock by default seems to create a Strict mock Not entirely sure which one I like better they both seem to fit the bill. Thanks Oleg     Joe As far as I know Mockito started out as a fork of EasyMock. Both frameworks share a lot in common due to that. I find Mockito slightly nicer as it eliminates those pesky replay verify calls. http code.google.com p mockito wiki MockitoVSEasyMock Oleg
