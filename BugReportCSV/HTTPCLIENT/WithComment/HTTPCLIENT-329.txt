 API Doc Compile performance optimization guide
Performance optimization guide is long overdue and badly needed. The more people start using HttpClient in all sorts of creative ways the more we are going to need it. OlegAny takers for this one If no one volunteers I ll start working on it early next week. OlegIt s all yours. I ll be here for any proofreading or editing if needed. MikeCreated an attachment id 13841 Performance guide draft 1 Folks please let me know what you think. OlegI think this guide is very helpful Oleg. Thanks a lot Maybe we should not label it performance optimization guide but rather something like best practices as not all issues deal with performance only. BTW setting up a Wiki would be a nice thing so anybody could help improving documentation.Odi I do not mind it being called differently. I did try to concentrate primarily on the performance optimization though. And I would not call disabling cookie processing and stale connection check best practices but I really do not mind expanding the scope of the document OlegHi Oleg This looks like an excellent start. Though this document does appear to be a combination of best practices and optimization techniques. Perhaps we should try to separate these two things and have docs for both I also agree that HttpClient is long overdue for a Wiki. It would be particularly useful for adding responses to the many questions we see over and over again something like a combination FAQ troubleshooting guide. MikeMike I thought about it and felt that there was not enough content for two documents. What if we left this document what it is a performance guide and had another one dedicated exclusively to does and donts best practices of HttpClient probably based on Wiki resources What do you think OlegHi Oleg Sounds like a plan. MikeFolks how do you want to proceed further with this at this point OlegHi Oleg I say go ahead and commit it. We can always move things around if we need to. MikeCould any native English speaker proofread the document before I commit it OlegCreated an attachment id 13986 Doc patch This patch cleans up some of the text and adds a little here and there. It also includes the changes Odi made. I think this document looks pretty good now though I agree with Odi that the Reuse the HttpClient instance seems a little unnecessary. The only real thing I think we need to encourage reuse of is the connection managers. This is covered some for the MTCM but we could still use a little something in regard to the simple connection manager. MikeThe document patched and committed. Odi Mike feel free to make corrections you deem necessary with regards to HttpClient reuse Oleg
