HttpMethodBase aborted variable mistakenly declared transient instead of volatile
HttpMethodBase aborted variable mistakenly declared transient instead of volatile. This is quite nasty. Do we want to cut an emergency release 3.0.2 because of that or can this wait until 3.1-beta1 Fix attached. OlegI would not make an emergency release unless we have a user that experiences a severe threading issue when calling abort . If necessary we can always do that within ours.I m with Odi. No need for an emergency release if nobody is experiencing problems. I haven t used volatile since the times when I was programming in C and assembler and I don t remember having Java threading issues because of that. Still I ll keep it in mind and silently put some volatile declarations into HttpAsync - cheers   Roland Patch checked in Oleg
