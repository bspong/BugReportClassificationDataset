Log level for message should be debug instead of error.
In method org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.getResponseBody Log message should be logged as debug instead of error. 717 catch IOException e 718 LOG.error I O failure reading response body e 719 this.responseBody null 720 According to HTTPCLIENT-57 2 Only always log exception stack traces at the debug level          catch Exception ex             log.debugI find the problem to be a little more fundamental than the log verbosity level. Both HttpMethod getResponseBody HttpMethod getResponseBodyAsString should propagate IOException to the caller instead of just logging it. I belielve this problem warrants the 2.0 API compatibility breakage. Patch to follow shortly OlegCreated an attachment id 10279 Patch take 1 Patch committed. Oleg
