Port fix for HTTPCLIENT-633 to 4.0
The fix for MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager from HTTPCLIENT-633 should be ported to ThreadSafeClientConnManager in 4.0.I think we ought not simply port the fix but we should try to replace the notification mechanism based on Thread interrupt to that based on Object wait Object notify OlegSo do I. But you urged me not to screw with the logic until we ve got test coverage and I d like to keep it in sync with MTHCM until then. cheers   Roland I would leave it with Thread.interrupt for now. Using object.wait will be much more complicated and will require java.util.concurrent or an implementation of Mutex inside HttpConn. Mike
