Code cleanups for Java 1.5 and more.
I can t resist giving code a good cleansing when I start hacking. Here s some simple things - Use character constants instead of string contstants - Use java 1.5 style for loops - Use StringBuilder where appropriate - Fix javadocs - switch somestring.equals to .length 0 - simplify some boolean expressions - eliminate redundant initializers - fix some html nits - remove final keyword from static methods diff against Revision 652962 Just curious - what s the benefit of using char constants rather than string constants Patch checked in with some minor tweaks. I am also not quite sure the use of chars instead of strings really makes a difference. So I left a number of occurrences unchanged mainly in the exception messages. Many thanks Paul Oleglooks good thanks. btw single-char vs string is mostly a memory issue. A char constant can be stored in 2 bytes a string requires something like 24 bytes 2 bytes for the actual characters. Also consider the common case of appending a char and you can see there is a little bit less work involved public AbstractStringBuilder JavaDoc append char c      int newCount count 1      if newCount value.length          expandCapacity newCount      value count c      return this   vs public AbstractStringBuilder append String str      if str null str null      int len str.length      if len 0 return this      int newCount count len      if newCount value.length          expandCapacity newCount      str.getChars 0 len value count      count newCount      return this
