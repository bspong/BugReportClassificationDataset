 GSoC 2011 Fluent API to HttpClient
Develop fluent API facade to HttpClient based on code currently maintained by Apache Stanbol and Apache Sling projects. For details see http markmail.org message mmyljtgjp3za6kyz or contact Apache HttpComponents committers at dev hc.apache.orgIÕm a computer science third year student who willing to participate for GSOC 2011 and i am interested in this project idea. I would like to know further details on this topic. Looking forward to hear from you. Thanks in advance.Imalka A successful completion of this project would require the following 1 Good understanding of the HttpClient 4.x API 2 Certain familiarity with the HTTP protocol in general 3 Familiarity with the concept of fluent interface 1 4 Interest and ideally experience in designing APIs 5 Liaising with several Apache projects primarily HttpComponents and Apache Stanbol in incubation and ability to reconcile different often conflicting ideas about interface API design In sort key requisites are HttpClient knowledge understanding of fluent interface API design and good communication. Hope this gives you enough details pointers for a GSoC proposal. Oleg 1 http en.wikipedia.org wiki Fluent interfaceSource code and JavaDoc of the first submission.Lilu I put UriBuilder to the HttpClient module 1 and the rest to the new fluent-hc module 2 Please get the latest snapshot of HttpClient from SVN and try to build it from source There is also a number of things that need fixing 1 Please never use Throwable printStackTrace inside a library Either rethrow exceptions with a different type rethrow checked exception as an unchecked one if appropriate handle it if it can be handled internally by the class or in extreme cases log it through commons-logging. 2 FluentResponse currently depends on JUnit code which is not okay in my opinion. Since there was no response from the Stanbol folks I we do not really know how important it is for them. I suggest we either remote the JUnit specific code or at least move it to the test folder for the time being. 3 Some test coverage would be quite useful Cheers Oleg 1 http svn.apache.org repos asf httpcomponents httpclient trunk httpclient src main java org apache http client utils UriBuilder.java 2 http svn.apache.org repos asf httpcomponents httpclient trunk fluent-hc 1. Re-organized the structure of fluent-hc module. Two classes FluentHttp and RequestBuilder have been removed. 2. FluentRequest now has more constructors. 3. Some JUnit 4 test cases have been added into the codes. 4. Fixed some bugs e.g. print exception s tracking info .Lilu I committed the patch to SVN trunk. Please review. This officially concludes your participation in the GSoC 2011 program and results of your work will be evaluated based on the current content of the repository. Nonetheless you are very welcome to continue contributing to the project beyond GSoC. Oleg
