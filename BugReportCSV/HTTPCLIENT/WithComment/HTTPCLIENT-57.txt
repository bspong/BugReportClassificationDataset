Define and implement Logging policy
When to use info vs debug vs warning When to log exceptions enter and exit messages on a per method basis Always log debug when swallowing an exception Some suggestions to be applied across the package 1 log.trace enter SomeClass.SomeMethod Object Object on every method entry 2 Only log exception stack traces at the debug level 3 Any swallowed exceptions should log the exception at the debug level 4 Info messages should be suitable for users to viewMore refined 1 Log the entry to every method at the trace level. exits not required due to difficulty in determing exit points         log.trace enter SomeClass.SomeMethod Class Class 2 Only always log exception stack traces at the debug level          catch Exception ex             log.debug 3 Any swallowed exceptions should log the exception at the debug level         try             thread.sleep          catch InterruptedException ie              expected             log.debug Caught interrupted exception          4 Error Warn Info messages should be suitable for users to view. Code specific details should be kept to Debug and Trace. 5 instantiate one static logger per class like this         private static final Log log LogFactory.getLog CLASS.class 6 Any messages that are passed over an open network connection should be logged on the wirelog         private static final Log wireLog LogFactory.getLog httpclient.wire 7 Any logging statement that causes other method calls in the construction of its arguments must be protected by a isXXXEnabled conditional except when already protected by a try catch block         if log.isDebugEnabled             log.debug some text someVar some more text                  try              some code          catch Exception ex             log.warn Failed to execute some code ex.getMessage             log.debug Unexpected exception caught ex          8 At this point there will be no internationalization of logging messages but it may be added in the future.Created an attachment id 2510 First pass through all classes for logging policy changes. HTTPCLIENT-93 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. Created an attachment id 2522 Make all wireLog output be at debug level. Complete.
