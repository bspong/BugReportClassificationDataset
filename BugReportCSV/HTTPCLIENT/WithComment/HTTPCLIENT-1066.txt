HTTPClient 4.1 auto slash removal
I ve put the same comment as in the following issue. https issues.apache.org jira browse HTTPCLIENT-929 focusedCommentId 13001748 comment-13001748 I am using httpclient 4.1. I had a problem with this fix. In DefaultRequestDirector.rewriteRequestURI method for non-proxied URI and when it is a absolute URI it will call the URIUtils.rewriteURI which then take the RawPath from an uri and normalize it. So when I pass an uri for example http www.whatever.com 1 3 it will automatically remove the extra slash and become http www.whatever.com 1 3. I ve got a REStful service to accept the uri param1 param2 param3 and it takes when there is an empty value past in. Now because of the auto slash removal the 3 value shift left for a position and match to the param2 . I wouldn t say the above solution is wrong but I guess it should not change what value that user pass in.Causing issue after the fix.I just can t make everyone happy can I I ll try to revert the changes to URIUtils rewriteURI method without completely breaking the fix for HTTPCLIENT-929. OlegI hanged the way URIUtils rewriteURI handles multiple consecutive slashes in the URI path component multiple leading slashes will be replaced by one slash in order to avoid confusion with the authority component. The remaining content of the path component will not be modified. Please re-test your application against the latest SVN snapshot. OlegThanks Oleg. It seems all working fine with me now.
