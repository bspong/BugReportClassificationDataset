303 Redirects are not handled properly
When the server spits back a 303 See Other the redirect is not handled. Looking at the code I saw that the processRedirectResponse method in HttpMethodBase does not check for SC SEE OTHER in the case statement. SC SEE OTHER is a redirect and should be handled appropriately. Here is a trace from the output of the client and server. GET http 172.30.229.75 CGI Screenshot HTTP 1.1 Authorization Basic c3VwZXJ1c2VyOnJvb3Q Host 172.30.229.75 User-Agent Jakarta Commons-HttpClient 2.0M1 HTTP 1.1 303 See Other Location http 172.30.229.75 FS CIP 0 5842 Content-Length 0 Server snip Easy fix for this one. Now the follwoing are handled as redirects   HttpStatus.SC MOVED TEMPORARILY   HttpStatus.SC MOVED PERMANENTLY   HttpStatus.SC SEE OTHER   HttpStatus.SC TEMPORARY REDIRECT Added some tests to ensure that all of these redirect correctly.
