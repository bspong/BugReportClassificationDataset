make SchemeRegistry friendlier for DI frameworks
Scheme s in SchemeRegistry are registered via register method but there is no way to pass it a set of schemes so those can be registered in one step. This way it can be externally configured and spring guice friendly ... something like this is sufficient... public void setSchemes final Set Scheme schemes     for final Scheme scheme schemes         register scheme Similar change should also be made to CookieSpecRegistry and AuthSchemeRegistry classes. I ll be happily to check in a patch - Olegfor other two I will investigateImplemented in SVN trunk Oleg
