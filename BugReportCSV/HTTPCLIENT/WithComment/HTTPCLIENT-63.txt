Response handlers
Perhaps plugin handlers should be used to handle various ranges of http responses. Could be used to respond auto-forward resubmit ... Could solve the difficulty in handling a 303 response.Fixed in SVN trunk. HttpClient can now make use of pluggable redirect handlers. Authentication handler is coming soon.
