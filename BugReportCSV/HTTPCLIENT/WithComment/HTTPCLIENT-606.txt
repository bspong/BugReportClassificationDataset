HttpMethodDirector fails when redirecting to a encoded URL location
When HttpMethodDirector handles the case of redirecting the incoming connection to the location specified in the header of the http caller method if this location has any special charset encoding extended charsets like ISO 8859-1 etc. the redirection fails this way dd-MMM-YYYY hh mm ss org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector processRedirectResponse WARNING Redirected location http www.anyCharsetEncodedUrl.ko 39 is malformed You can test it using this class public class SimpleHttpTestNotWorking public static int urlStatus String pUrl throws org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpException java.io.IOException org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient client new org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethod method new org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods.GetMethod pUrl return client.executeMethod method public static void main String args try String url http www.dipualba.es municipios F E9rez known problematic URL System.out.println Return code for url SimpleHttpTestWorking.urlStatus url catch Exception e e.printStackTrace What I ve done to solve it for my particular case has been 1 In the requester side I ve modified the calling public class SimpleHttpTestWorking public static int urlStatus String pUrl throws org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpException java.io.IOException org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient client new org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethod method String encoding String client.getParams .getParameter http.protocol.content-charset client.getParams .setParameter http.protocol.element-charset encoding try method new org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods.GetMethod pUrl catch IllegalArgumentException iae try org.apache.commons.httpclient.URI uri new org.apache.commons.httpclient.URI pUrl true method new org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods.GetMethod uri.getURI catch org.apache.commons.httpclient.URIException ue org.apache.commons.httpclient.URI uri new org.apache.commons.httpclient.URI pUrl false encoding method new org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods.GetMethod uri.getEscapedURI return client.executeMethod method public static void main String args try String url http www.dipualba.es municipios F xE9 rez the same problematic URL System.out.println Return code for url SimpleHttpTestWorking.urlStatus url catch Exception e e.printStackTrace 2 In org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector.processRedirectResponse HttpMethod method I ve replaced ... redirectUri new URI location true ... for the following code ...

Hope it helps modified class HttpMethodDirectorSamuel Could you please create a patch in diff -u format against SVN trunk OlegPatch applied over jakarta commons proper httpclient trunk src java org apache commons httpclient HttpMethodDirector.java revision Revision 413281.Samuel Here is a slightly different take at fixing the problem. Please review and comment OlegOleg I think your version does the right thing. IMHO redirect URLs must be URL encoded in any case. So no point in first trying with the wrong one and on exception trying the right charset as in Samuel s patch.Oleg the patch that you suggest is not working for me both for the escaped problematic URL that i ve tried http www.dipualba.es municipios F E9rez and for it s parsed version of the same URL using ISO-8859-1 charset encoding. Samuel. OK. I see the problem with the patch. The HTTP element charset defaults to US-ASCII whereas the default URI charset should be UTF-8. I see no way around adding a new HTTP parameter specifically for the URI charset. New patch attached. Please review. OlegLooks correct.Hi Oleg It s still not working for me. The problem is in the class HttpMethodDirector and is not when building the URI in a specific charset but when reading the attribute location used to build that URI Header locationHeader method.getResponseHeader location String location locationHeader.getValue The attribute responseHeaders of the method method contains the location where to redirect but it looks like it has not been properly parsed. The first try-catch block in my original patch was for handling both escaped and non.escaped location values.Samuel This server is misbehaving. It returns non-ASCII characters in a HTTP header which is a gross violation of the spec 2006 11 22 17 08 26 625 CET DEBUG header - - Location http www.dipualba.es municipios F rez r n The server must URL-encode the URL in UTF-8 correctly. There is nothing we can do.Hi I m encountering the same problem version 3.0.1 when trying to load the following URL with HTTPClient http www.comedycentral.com sitewide droplets podRedirect.jhtml redirect.m4v feed ComedyCentralStandUpPodcastForResearch file http a1926.g.akamai.net downloadstor.download.akamai.com 10768 comedy podcasts standup 133 standup.m4v This is an enclosure URL from the RSS feed at http feeds.feedburner.com comedycentral standup I ve noticed that other feeds from FeedBurner misbehave in the same way. Please note that Firefox and IE manage to redirect despite this encoding problem thanks OriIf I hear no complaints I ll check in the fix httpmethoddir.patch . OlegPatch checked in Oleg
