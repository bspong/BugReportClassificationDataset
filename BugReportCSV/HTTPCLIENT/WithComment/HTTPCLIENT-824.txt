Review the use of BaiscHttpParams and HttpProtocolProcessor in HttpClient
Review the use of BaiscHttpParams and HttpProtocolProcessor in HttpClient and replace with thread-safe implementations where necessary. OlegI reviewed the code and found the following 1 HttpClient correctly synchronizes access to its ProtocolProcessor instance variable. It also makes a copy of it before passing it the request director so the master copy can be safely mutated while current requests are being executed. No problem here. 2 Things are a bit messy with HttpParams. BasicHttpParams classes is used all over the place. Decorating those with a non-public thread-safe wrapper inside HttpClient does not really help as the user can still mutate its state using the original reference. The problem can be solved only by introducing a public thread-safe implementation of HttpParams which we cannot do until 4.1 OlegFixed in SVN trunk Oleg
