I do not know if 2.0 causes any problems for users but it seems like a pretty big change for this release. Perhaps we can wait until after 2.0 is released. How does everyone feel about this MikeThe problem is that HttpClient will be implicitly licensed under the new license. So we will cause less confusion if we directly include the new lincense now. See www.apache.org licenses All packages produced by the ASF are implicitly licensed under the Apache License version 2.0 unless otherwise explicitly stated. The license at the top of the file is the explicit statement that paragraph has an exception for. So if we were to release 2.0 as is it would be under the 1.0 license. I think if we are considering putting out a release under the 1.0 license we should get approval from the PMC. Personally I would release under the 2.0 license.Roy Fielding states When modifying the copyright notice for Apache software the name of the copyright owner must be stated as in the following examples    Copyright 2004 The Apache Software Foundation. or    Copyright 2002-2004 The Apache Software Foundation. or    Copyright 2002 2004 The Apache Software Foundation.
