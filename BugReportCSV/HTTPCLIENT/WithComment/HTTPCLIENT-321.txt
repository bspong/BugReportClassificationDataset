wrong charset indication in HttpConstants.getContentString 
Around line 236 in HttpConstants.getConstentString the charset is wrongly indicated as DEFAULT CONTENT CHARSET where it should have been indicated as charset like in the getContentBytes function.             if LOG.isWarnEnabled                 LOG.warn Unsupported encoding                      DEFAULT CONTENT CHARSET should be the variable charset here                      . Default HTTP encoding used              Wrong copy paste I guess - ZC.Yep. I ll apply a fix tonight OlegProblem fixed in both 2.0 and CVS HEAD. Oleg
