Change access to internal maps of HttpState to protected.
To be able to serialize the conversational state of a http session access to the internal maps of HttpState is required. Currently they are all private so subclasses cannot access them. Changing the access to protected will allow any subclass to access those maps.Changing attribute visibility in HttpState will only affect applications that extend this class and use the same attribute names. If I am not mistaken Java allows re-use of attribute names in derived classes and scoping will make sure that the behavior remains the same as it is now. If there are problems with name clashes the workaround is to rename the attributes in the derived classes. Based on the non-impact on existing applications I am in favor of this change. cheers   Roland Here s a patch that changes both credential maps and the cookie list to protected. For the other attributes there are getter and setter methods available. cheers   Roland Looks good to me Oleg
