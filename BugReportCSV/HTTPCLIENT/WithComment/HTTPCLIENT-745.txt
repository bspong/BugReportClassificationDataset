no classes with default visibility
There should be no classes with default package visibility. They cause problems when classes using them are extended. All classes should either be public or nested with protected visibility where they are used. Nesting with private visibility may be acceptable in certain cases for example in final classes. Along with these visibility fixes I think some attention should be placed on classes who shared their variables directly as opposed to through a getter . This is sometimes OK for subclasses but rarely good for other classes that use the objects. There s a small number of classes that have non-private variables especially in the impl.conn impl.conn.tsccm packages.Agreed - apart from the issue of encapsulation shared variables if not final are generally not thread-safe.Fixed in SVN trunk Oleg
