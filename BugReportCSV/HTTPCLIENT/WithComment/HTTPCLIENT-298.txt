javadoc often has without
Just to mention it there are a lot of javadoc comments that read like Ê tt false ff otherwise. which prints the rest of the document in tt can t give a complete list it happens very often. To check just go to the bottom of a page and see if it appears in tt or code HttpClient javadocs undisputably still leave much more to be desired. BTW we happily accept javadoc patches - OlegJavadocs patched.
