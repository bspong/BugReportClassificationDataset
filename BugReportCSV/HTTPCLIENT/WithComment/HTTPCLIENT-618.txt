Eliminate class HostConfiguration
Remove the target host attribute from the HostConfiguration class. This will allow one HostConfiguration object to be used for different targets. The problem is that currently MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager uses HostConfiguration objects as cache keys which needs to be changed. This is a followup to HTTPCLIENT-615. cheers   Roland HostConfiguration currently serves multiple purposes 1 - represents a route 2 - externally provided routing configuration 3 - lookup key in ThreadSafeClientConnManager The final purpose needs to be determined first. This issue assumes that the only purpose will be 2. The HostConfiguration class can be replaced by the HttpRoute class completely. External routing information such as selecting a proxy or local interface for a target is better addressed by encapsulating the logic in an interface. If something like the HostConfiguration class w o target host is needed it can be re-introduced with the same or a better name. HostConfiguration is gone. The biggest problem turned out to be not ThreadSafeClientConnManager but the parameters with their route hostconfig-based map of maximum connections allowed. I ll create another issue for revising these parameters. cheers   Roland
