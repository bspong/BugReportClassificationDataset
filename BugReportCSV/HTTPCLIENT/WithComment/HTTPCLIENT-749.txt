HttpClient ParamBeans for easier configuration
As I did for a core here I would like to contribute for client part as few ParamBeans for easier external configuration... Any comment or improvement is very welcome...Stojce Would it be a big deal for you to submit the changes in unified diff udiff format OlegHi Stojce I like the idea and thanks for taking care of it. I m just a bit concerned because I will completely rework the parameters for connection managers hopefully for the next alpha. We ll have to keep the beans in sync then. cheers   Roland Patch checked in. Many thanks Stojce Oleg
