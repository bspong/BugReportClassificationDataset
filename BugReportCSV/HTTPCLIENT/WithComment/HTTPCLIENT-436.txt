Retry on ConnectionException does not work
I noticed that the Retry handler mechanism does not work when the client cannot initiate a connection which throws java.net.ConnectionException . This happens for me for instance when there is proxy and a tunneling in the picture and sometimes there are connectivity problems. I had my own RetryHandler however the Connection Timeout exception never falls in it. I took a look at the source code and noticed that the open method and any thrown exception at this level occurs outside the control of the Retry Handler which seems to be involved only after open succeeds . In fact if the open throws ConnectionException as is my case since the try catch wrapping the open is not inside the while but on top of it it stops the loop and the retry handler does not get a chance to be invoked . riadCreated an attachment id 14341 Patch take 1 This should take care of the problem.

Thanks for the fix. riadAny objections to committing this patch OlegLooks good to me. MikePatch committed. Oleg
