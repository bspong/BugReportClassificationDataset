toplevel exception cleanup
HttpClient.execute should throw only one exception for easier general use. HttpMethod constructors HttpGet HttpPut etc.. should throw IllegalArgumentException in the string constructor imply the string is pre-checked . People wanting to see a URIException can use new HttpGet new URI uri and trigger the exception from the explicit URI creation.patch attached.Sam I think it is a pretty bad idea to re-throw protocol exceptions as a plain vanilla IOException. Could you please create a special subclass of IOException ClientProtocolException or some such for that end I still would like to have an option to catch protocol exceptions thrown by the HttpClient execute method. OlegSure thing that s a good idea.take two.Sam go ahead and commit the patch. OlegCommitted.
