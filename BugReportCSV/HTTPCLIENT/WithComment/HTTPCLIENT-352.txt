Allow polymorphic use of addParameter
I have some common code in a reverse proxy server that uses addParameter on instances of both PostMethod and MultipartPostMethod It would be great if either addParameter were made an abstract method on ExpectContinueMethod or both were made to implement a common base class. Here s my workaround     private void addPostParameter ExpectContinueMethod method String name String value         if method instanceof PostMethod              PostMethod method .addParameter name value          else if method instanceof MultipartPostMethod              MultipartPostMethod method .addParameter name value          else             throw new IllegalArgumentException addPostParameter is only defined for PostMethod and MultipartPostMethod                             whoa - smells pretty badI don t think ExpectContinueMethod is the place to add this from a design point of view. EntityEnclosingMethod sounds more appropriate except that MultiPartPostMethod is not derived from it. There s probably an implementation specific reason for that. However both would affect PutMethod which does not allow parameters to be set at all. I guess the best approach would be to define an interface something like ParameterCarryingMethod which could be implemented by PostMethod as well as MultipartPostMethod. That s for the 3.0 API of course since the 2.0 API has already been finalized. cheers   RolandSounds reasonable. I am afraid this will have to wait until the complete redesign targeted for the release 4.0 though OlegWith the new API this issue is no longer relevant. You add parameters to UrlEncodedFormEntity currently in package o.a.h.client.methods and set that entity on the request you want to execute no matter what method. cheers   Roland
