Deprecate and replace SimpleHttpConnection with the SimpleHttpServer based testing framework
Thanks to Christian Kohlschuetter and Odi we now have a very flexible testing framework which enables us to emulate pretty much all the aspects of a HTTP server functionality including non-compliant behavior and various vendor specific implementation quirks. Many many thanks go to Christian Kohlschuetter for having contributed the original code. I propose SimpleHttpConnection be deprecated and eventually be phased out. I took the first steps toward this goal by migrating Basic authentication test cases. I urge all committers and contributors to use SimpleHttpServer for all the new cases from now on. Ideally in the future we should even be able to get rid of Tomcat as a dependency for testing. I also took liberty of tweaking the SimpleHttpServer API a little. I factored SimpleRequest and SimpleResponse classes out and provided a new interface called HttpService which can be used instead of HttpRequestHandler to implement test cases in a way very similar to writing servlets. I ll commit the patch shortly as it does not really touch any productive code.

The only real item of interest here is that the connection in SimpleHttpConnectionManager has been made protected. If there are no objections I will apply the patch tomorrow.
