Security issue - DigestScheme uses constant nonce count value
The nonce count value in DigestScheme is static set to 00000001 and never changes. also seen as comment in said file . This means that it fails against servers that correctly detect man-in-the-middle or replay attacks leading to additional 401 requests every second time or such servers must be configured to turn such checks off which is either poor security or poor for performance . I suggest that at minimum this count is incremented for every call to DigestScheme createDigest. It should also be an instance variable instead of a static as it really relates to the challenge assuming cases where instances are cached for reuse . AtomicInteger is a good choice for implementing this counter. See RFC 2617 chapters 3.2.2 and 3.2.3DIGEST auth algorithm implementation in HttpClient has not changed much since 2003. Could you please review test the patch attached to this issue and let me know if it fixes the problem for you OlegYes that worksPatch checked in. Oleg
