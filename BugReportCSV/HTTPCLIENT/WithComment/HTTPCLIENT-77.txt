Implement Connection Timeouts
I was writing test code to use the setSoTimeout int millis method to set a timeout value when connecting to a URL. It appears to me that no matter what I set the timeout to be a HttpConnection will try to connect but uses some other timeout value I m guessing the OS s default value . I looked at the code for HttpConnection and it uses the Socket host port constructor which tries to connect write away. I d like to suggest the following code below so the timeout is set before first the connection is even made. Compile the code as is and it should timeout within a sec. If you   uncomment the first two lines after the try statement and comment   out the other socket connect statements and run the code again you will   notice write away that the timeout is something else because it connects   right away in the constructor. Its like the timeout is worthless at this   point. As a matter a fact the code should never get there.   This all assumes that 192.168.168.50 is not on your network.   import java.io. import java.net. public class SocketTest     public static void main String args         long start System.currentTimeMillis         try              Socket socket new Socket 192.168.168.50 80              socket.setSoTimeout 1000              Setting timeout before the connection is made.             Socket socket new Socket             InetSocketAddress sAddress                 new InetSocketAddress 192.168.168.50 80             socket.connect sAddress 1000          catch UnknownHostException e             System.out.println e          catch SocketException e             System.out.println e          catch IOException e             System.out.println e                  System.out.println System.currentTimeMillis - start      Socket.connect SocketAddress int is a JDK 1.4 feature and as such not feasible from within HttpClient as we need to be 1.3 compatible. I suggest we realize a timeout at the HttpConnection level which is configurable at construction time. Setting prio to high as this is a frequently requested feature.
