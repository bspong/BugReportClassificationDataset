 Maven Migrate checkstyle.properties to XML
Newer Checkstyle versions used with latest Maven builds can not use the old properties configuration file. They work with XML configuration files. checkstyle.properties must be migrated in order to use a current version of Maven.Created an attachment id 7934 Draft by Laura Werner Created an attachment id 8434 proposed patch I migrated the old properties file to the new XML format. Some of the properties in the old file are not available in XML. Also the new XML format provides a lot more options now. We should maybe have a closer look one day. After you apply the patch make sure to use a recent Maven version. This file has been tested with the site generate target. OdiOdi Looks good to me except for the Javadoc version tag. I think we want to remove the following line property name versionFormat value null MikeOdi I just realized that you have committed the patch. Do you think the bug report can be closed or there is still something that you would like to do about it OlegCommitted.
