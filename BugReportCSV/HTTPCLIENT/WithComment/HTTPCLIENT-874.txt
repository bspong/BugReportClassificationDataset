Override method MultipartEntity.addPart so that applications may use FormBodyPart
FormBodyPart is similar to Part in HttpClient 3.x in that it couples the form name with the value. Some applications may find this useful but cannot really utilize these objects since there is only MultipartEntity.addPart String name ContentBody and FormBodyPart does not have a getContent method   entity.addPart part.getName part.getContent Almost but there is no getContent method How about overriding addPart to take a FormBodyPart object   entity.addPart part Attached patch to implement addPart override method.The patch has method signature addPart BodyPart it could ve been more specific like addPart FormBodyPart which would make the API less confusing since these classes cross projects FormBodyPart is HttpMime BodyPart is James Patch checked in.
