Add shutdown method to SimpleHttpConnectionManager
It would be useful to be able to close the connection in the SimpleHttpConnectionManager. This could be achieved by adding a shutdown method as per the MultiThreadedConnectionManager. Ideally this would be added to the HttpConnection interface but this could break existing implementations. To avoid this perhaps consider introducing a sub-interface with the method in it. Could also create an AbstractConnectionManager class - this would make it easier to add more functions later Patch take 1 . Please review OlegI m not so sure about the HttpConnectionManagerExt interface. Seems like we should either leave it out and just add the method to SHCM or change the connection manager interface. My inclination would be for the former. MikeInterface extension is not pretty but it is the only way I know of to add new methods to a public interface without breaking the API compatibility. Anyways let us leave it until 4.0. Patch take 2 OlegSounds good. MikeLooks OK to me apart from minor nits The copyright on the new interface file says 1999-2006 which is impossible ... with the current rules it should just be 2006 as I understand it. shcm.patch says since 3.1 - should that not be since 4.0 shcm.patch says since 3.1 - should that not be since 4.0 No mistake here. shutdown method has been added to the SHCM class and not the HCM interface. This will have to wait until 4.0 Patch checked in Oleg
