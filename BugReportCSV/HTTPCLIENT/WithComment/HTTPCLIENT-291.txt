MikeCreated an attachment id 8885 Result of changing the HttpMethodBase 2449 Ooops Sorry the attachment entitled Result of changing the HttpMethodBase 2449 was for other bug . Can please someone delete it from this bug Mike looks good. Go ahead commit it. Oleg PS Currently the Sample code URL on the HttpClient s site points to CVS HEAD which can easily cause confusion for neophytes. The URL should probably be changed to http cvs.apache.org viewcvs.cgi jakarta-commons httpclient src examples only with tag HTTPCLIENT 2 0 BRANCH This is a fairly small thing I think so I will not open a separate bug report for it unless you tell me to do so.Patch applied. Link fixed. Mike
