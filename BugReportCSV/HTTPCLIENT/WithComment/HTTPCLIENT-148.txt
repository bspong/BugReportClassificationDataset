Redirect to a relative URL fails
Request the url http commerce1.cera.net discount-pcbooks catalog categories.asp search str 0782128092 On a browser the redirect works while with HttpClient it doesn t.Need more information. Please generate a log for this request and add it to the bug report.This bug occured when the server sent back a redirect to a relative URL. In the example IIS is redirecting to a location edirecting from http commerce1.cera.net 80 discount-pcbooks catalog categories.asp search str 0782128092 39 to http commerce1.cera.net 80 discount-pcbooks catalog catalog search.asp cat id 0 search str 0782128092 While rfc2616 explictily requires Location header to be an absolute URI we are now handling this non-standard redirect when strict mode is off. A test has been added to explicitly test this type of relative redirect. HTTPCLIENT-89 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug.
