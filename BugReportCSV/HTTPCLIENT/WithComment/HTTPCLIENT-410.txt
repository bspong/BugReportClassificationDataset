Typos in MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager
I ve done a review of the MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager class in 3.0-beta1 especially focussing on the documentation. In general it could use a lot of improvement IMHO. This bug report only deals with some typos I found in the class and some minimal style improvements that are compatible with the other classes. I will attach a proposed patch.Created an attachment id 13813 Proposed patch Patch committed. Many thanks Ernst. Oleg
