Make MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager defaults public statics.
Could the defaults for MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager be made public constants I would do it my self since I have karma as a contributer to lang and codec but I do not want to step on anyones toes. - Patch attached.Created an attachment id 7007 MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager patch to v.1.16 Hello Gary. I would be happy to make this change if you like. I am just wondering why you want static access to these values. MikeI am configuring a component that uses HttpClient in its guts. This component is configured via an XML file. We use JAXB to generate XML IO code from an XSD for this XML config file. Right now the default value in the XSD has to be matched by hand to the default values in HttpClient as well as our other settings. I would like to be able to fill in the default values in the XSD based on constants for all of the pieces that must be configured. This means that the real constant definition is in one place and one place only.Patch committed with a minor tweak. Mike
