New method to add an array of parameters to PostMethod
When posting a form a web page may have many parameters to post to the webserver. Currently in PostMethod if you wanted to add multiple parameters you would have to call addParameter name value for each one. A new convinence method should be added to allow for simpler client code by taking an array of NameValuePair objects and adding all parameters in a single function call. void addParameters NameValuePair parameters Also the comments for PostMethod functions that deal with parameters state Override method of HttpMethodBase ... which is incorrect. More informative comments should be added to this public API.Should also add a method void addParameter NameValuePair parameter The addParameter methods that are in the PostMethod should actually be moved out to the base class GetMethod and mabye even higher into HttpMethodBase. It does make sense for a GET to have parameters they are in the query string as opposed to a POST which are url encoded and send in the body. The ease in which a form can be submitted in a html page using either GET or POST should be parallel to the GetMethod and PostMethod. Ê Only POST methods afaik take a x-www-form-urlencoded content header which seems to be the purpose of the setParameter and such methods. The parameters would be urlencoded using URIUtil.encode presumably and stuffed in the content body. The query string if any remains part of the URL. The query string and the parameters are independant so it does makes sense that there are different methods to handle them as it is currently. It would just be nice to add a bunch of parameters as a NameValuePair array in the same way that you already can with the query string.
