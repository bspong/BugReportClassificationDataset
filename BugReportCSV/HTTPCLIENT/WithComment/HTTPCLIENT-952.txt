SSLSocketFactory.createSSLContext does not process trust store
org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.createSSLContext does not process a provided trust store. Only the default cacerts is processed. An additional provided trust store is ignored. Adding the trusted certificate to the keystore the peer is authenticated. Eventually         tmfactory.init keystore needs to be         tmfactory.init truststore Many thanks for tracking down and reporting the bug Angela. Fix committed to the SVN trunk. OlegHello Oleg Want to test the fix you made. I am using trunk but have problems generating the jar file with maven for httpclient. For httpcore I can generate a jar in target. Can you find an error in the log see below Can you please sent me a jar based on trunk because I have to forward it to a project I did only the PoC.

If you just want to generate a JAR without running any tests try executing mvn compile jar jar OlegHello Oleg I will try the mvn compile .. Just wanted to let you know that the fix trust store worked. Thanks a lot. What I was looking for was a comparison against JSSE. Why would developers use HttpComponents over JSSE. Could not find something in the wiki. Can you help me out. Thanks Angela Hi Angela A question like the above posted onto the mailing list would possibly get you the views from a larger segment of the community.. I think one of the main reasons for choosing HttpComponents Client is for its complete support for the HTTP protocol as per the specs. I doubt if one could easily do HTTP authentication Cookie manipulation etc with just JSSE cheers asankha
