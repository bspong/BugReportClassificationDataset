Move to commons-logging
Commons-logging was derived from httpclient.log still using the old logging which should be removed. Some complaints on mailing list about setting up commons-logging should be simple and well documented.Can i send in a patch As this one touches practically every file and changes a dependancy releationship and configuration settings you ll have to be careful with this one. You ll likely have to modify build.xml build.properties.sample and some documentation files as well. I m working on a few other changes that should make the build dependancies simple to handle as well so you might want to hold off for that. Feel free to assign that bug to yourself as I m sure it will be a high priority feature. You may also wish to consider the other logging bug to align all the useage of logging levels to be consistant should be submitted as a seperate patch . There might also want to get some discussion going on the mailing list for the requirements for what the policy should be http nagoya.apache.org bugzilla show bug.cgi id 10804Patch applied to local source tree for testing. Vote called for removal of the old httpclient.log package as it is no longer used.Patch provided by Dims applied.
