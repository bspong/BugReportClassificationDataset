NTLM Authentication No Longer Working In Latest Release
Our application has been working fine using NTLM auth with HttpClient for 3 years. We were most recently on 4.0.3. Upon upgrading to 4.1.2 NTLM stopped working. I tried both the new for 4.1 built-in NTLM and the old way of using JCIFS client.getAuthSchemes .register ntlm new NTLMSchemeFactory Using wireshark I can see that NTLM auth is not even attempted using 4.1.2. Rolling back to 4.0.3 immediately resolved this problem.Jeff I suspect authentication fails because the server also sends a SPNEGO kerberos challenge which takes precedence over NTLM. If the SPNEGO auth scheme fails NTLM authentication is not attempted due to HTTPCLIENT-1107. Anyway please attach wire context logs of both sessions successful with 4.0.3 and unsuccessful with 4.1.2 . OlegThat may well be the cause. I ll generate a wire log. Also I should note that with 4.1.2 use of a HTTP proxy that requires NTLM auth is also broken. Reverting to 4.0.3 fixed that problem as well.I ve attached the logs you requested.As I suspected DEBUG pool-1-thread-1 AbstractAuthenticationHandler.java 151 - Authentication schemes in the order of preference negotiate NTLM Digest Basic DEBUG pool-1-thread-1 AbstractAuthenticationHandler.java 161 - negotiate authentication scheme selected DEBUG pool-1-thread-1 NegotiateScheme.java 316 - Received challenge from the auth server DEBUG pool-1-thread-1 DefaultRequestDirector.java 1196 - Authorization challenge processed DEBUG pool-1-thread-1 DefaultRequestDirector.java 1224 - Authentication scope NEGOTIATE any realm 192.168.3.44 80 DEBUG pool-1-thread-1 DefaultRequestDirector.java 1231 - Found credentials DEBUG pool-1-thread-1 NegotiateScheme.java 179 - init 192.168.3.44 ERROR pool-1-thread-1 RequestTargetAuthentication.java 113 - Authentication error Invalid name provided Mechanism level Could not load configuration file C Windows krb5.ini The system cannot find the file specified HttpClient 4.1.2 picks the SPNEGO Kerberos auth scheme over NTLM which apparently has not been properly set up. You basically have three options here 1 Setup SPNEGO Kerberos 2 Unregister the Negotiate scheme altogether 3 Modify auth scheme order of preference to make HttpClient pick NTLM over SPNEGO Kerberos. Oleg Ê Duplicate of HTTPCLIENT-1107
