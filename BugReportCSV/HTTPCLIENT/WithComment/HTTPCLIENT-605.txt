junit dependency in pom.xml with default compile scope
The dependency set as defined in http www.ibiblio.org maven2 commons-httpclient commons-httpclient 3.0.1 commons-httpclient-3.0.1.pom includes junit but not with a scope test test . I suppose the junit dependency should have a test scope. Could someone fix this Because of this my application is packaged including junit 3.8.1 which adds 118KiB for nothing. Frank This has been fixed in the SVN trunk and the fix will be included in the next public release 3.1-beta1 http svn.apache.org repos asf jakarta commons proper httpclient trunk project.xml I do not think we are able supported to change the POMs of already published releases.
