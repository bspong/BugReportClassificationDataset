HttpURLConnection wrapper
Initial comments from Vincent Massol for this feature I am moving Jakarta Cactus from using the JDK HttpURLConnection to Commons HttpClient. However I have some public interface that return HttpURLConnection and I cannot break that contract with Cactus users. I propose to write a HttpURLConnection wrapper for HttpMethod I have actually already written it but I am currently testing it on Cactus and will make a proper donation once I am sure it works - i.e all the Cactus tests pass as before ... . I attach a preview of it for those interested. What do you think of including it in HttpClient distribution Thanks -VincentCreated an attachment id 2495 Vincent s preview of HttpURLConnection Added to the httpclient.util package. Needs a few minor changes to fit into httpclient like adding logging . Waiting for test cases before this bug can be closed. Made a few httpclientisms in the code logging and some comments.The initial work for this is complete. Any methods that were not implemented throw a suitable exception. This can be extended to implement more methods if required. Thanks Vincent.
