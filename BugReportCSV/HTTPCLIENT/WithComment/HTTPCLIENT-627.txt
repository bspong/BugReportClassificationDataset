overhaul connection manager and associated connection interface
MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager HttpHostConnection needs to be overhauled to provide a layer on top of OperatedClientConnection. Preliminary working names ThreadSafeClientConnManager ManagedClientConnection This implies some work on former HttpMethodDirector and HttpClient to verify completeness of the new connection management API. The API in org.apache.http.conn is ready for review. The connection manager implementations in o.a.h.impl.conn are stuck in transition and need more work. I ll clean up smaller things while writing test cases and leave the big one HTTPCLIENT-636 until we ve got test coverage. In org.apache.http .impl .client are skeletons for HttpClient and HttpRequestDirector. They are good enough to make use of the connection managers and to communicate directly or via tunnelled TLS SSL through a proxy as long as no authentication is required. cheers   Roland
