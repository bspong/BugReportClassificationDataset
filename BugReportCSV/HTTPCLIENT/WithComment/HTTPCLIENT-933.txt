All implementations of SchemeSocketFactory.createSocket HttpParams params ignore the params
Only TestTSCCMWithServer.StallingSocketFactory.createSocket HttpParams params ever uses the HttpParams parameter. All non-test implementations of the method ignore the parameter. Not sure why this version of the method exists if the parameter is never used - the parameterless method from SocketFactory could be used instead.Sebastian In some rare cases it might be necessary to pass initialisation parameters for the socket for instance when connecting through a SOCKS server http svn.apache.org repos asf httpcomponents httpclient trunk httpclient src examples org apache http examples client ClientExecuteSOCKS.java Oleg ÊSorry I d overlooked the examples. Might be an idea to document the implementations that ignore the parameter Also perhaps add a comment to the interface to say that the parameter is not generally required I tweaked javadocs of relevant classes to my best ability. Feel free to improve it further. OlegThat looks fine.
