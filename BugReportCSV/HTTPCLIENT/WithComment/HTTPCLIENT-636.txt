Revise internal data structures of ThreadSafeClientConnManager
ThreadSafeClientConnManager internal data structures can be improved - keep track of issued connections with weak references - use class derived from WeakReference instead of a lookup table for callbacks from ReferenceThread    or drop ReferenceThread in favor of occasionally polling the issued connections for leaks this will go into an extra issue - use wait notify instead of Thread.interrupt to unblock waiting threads Replacing the shared cleanup thread with a per-pool thread raises some tricky issues. The first attempt failed because the background thread prevents GC of the connection manager the thread keeps a reference to the ConnectionPool which is a nested class of the TSCCM. Will need to think about this a little more. Suggestions are welcome. cheers   Roland next steps - move TSCCM to a separate package - factor out some of the inner classes Done. The connection pool now a separate class no longer keeps a hard reference to the connection manager. The pool keeps a weak reference to the manager to detect GC. In that case the pool shuts itself down.
