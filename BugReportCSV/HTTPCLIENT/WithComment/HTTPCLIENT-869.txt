Incorrect incomplete product name in META-INF NOTICE file
The NOTICE file in the HttpClient jars is incorrect. It states HttpClient Copyright 1999-2009 Apache Software Foundation snip The leading blank line should be deleted and HttpClient should be Apache HttpComponents Client - HttpClient or similar as is the case for the source archive. Similarly for HttpMimeThe hc-jar-resource-bundle contains a modified NOTICE template. If the bundle is built and installed to the local repository the patch should fix the issue. The downside is we now have an additional component to maintain. Please review. OlegIt may well work but it looks tricky to maintain. I think it would be easier to fix the resources definitions to ensure that the N L files are copied to META-INF - no extra components to maintain as it s all done in the POMs.Forgot to say I m working on fixing the resources nowAlternative approach using resources rather than remote-resources plugin.That s actually much better. Please go ahead and commit.
