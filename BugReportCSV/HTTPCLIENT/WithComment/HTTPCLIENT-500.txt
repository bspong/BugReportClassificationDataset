Dependency URL broken for commons-logging
On http jakarta.apache.org commons httpclient dependencies.html there is a typo in the href to the logging dependency this should be http jakarta.apache.org commons logging Also applies to 2.0 branch. Patch committed. Will be fixed on next redeployment of the website.
