Provide a non-pooling connection manager
The current implementations of the connection managers all have a connection pool. For applications requiring only single requests very rarely this is overkill. We should provide a very simple connection manager that uses a connection only one time and then closes it right away.I think adding one extra flag in the SimpleHttpConnectionManager should take care of the problem.
