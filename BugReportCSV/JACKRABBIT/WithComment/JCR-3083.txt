Degrade gracefully when reading invalid date values
As noted in JCR-1996 it is possible for an old version of Jackrabbit to store date invalid date values in the repository. Currently such values cause exceptions when the repository attempts to read them. A better approach would be to automatically detect such dates and map them instead to string values to avoid losing any information. A client could then access the information as a string through the normal JCR API and would only get a ValueFormatException when trying to read the value as a date i.e. using the getDate method.Patch that will allow read operations on bundles that have corrupted date properties. The value will be read as string when trying to read it as a date fails. The type of the value is still date so any clients trying to access the value will still get an error. This helps with repository level operations that need to be able to read bundles without actually using the values. So just having old invalid date properties in the repository will not interfere with operations any more. Dealing with the errors that come from reading those specific dates is still to be handled by the client. 1 The extra complexity around InternalValue is justified by the fact that this way we can still keep the value type as date instead of string like I originally proposed.fixed in revision 1176423Merged to the 2.2 branch in revision 1176484.
