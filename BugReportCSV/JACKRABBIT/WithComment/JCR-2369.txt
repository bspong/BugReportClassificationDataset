Problem importing node with binary property in a repository configured with datastore
Using the importXML method of workspace to import some node containing binary properties the nodes are imported correctly and the value of the binary data property is imported However the binary data goes to the db persistenceManager an not to the datastore. Creating a new node of the same type using the api the binary data go to the datastore.Added maven test project created using Netbeans for reproduce the behaviour.I can reproduce the problem with Jackrabbit 1.6I have committed the bugfix in the 1.6 branch. The problem doesn t occur in trunk and in the 2.0 branch because of some other changes.
