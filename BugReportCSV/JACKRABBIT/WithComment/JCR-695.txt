Repository requires access to external resource
With the changes from JCR-626 jackrabbit requires access to the resource at the URL http jackrabbit.apache.org dtd repository-1.2.dtd. If no connection to the internet is available jackrabbit will refuse to start. At least that s the case when I run the test cases in the above mentioned environment. I m not an XML expert but shouldn t the doctype declaration use a public identifier Otherwise the ConfigurationEntityResolver class doesn t make much sense. The attached patch solve the issue for me please comment. I ve also targetted this issue for 1.2 because it seems rather serious to me if you can t start jackrabbit when you don t have an internet connection or am I the only one with this issue I noticed this same problem while testing 1.2 it s certainly a blocker. Using public identifiers with the ConfigurationEntityResolver seems like the correct solution but I think we should add a version number to the public identifier and we probably don t need separate identifiers for the Repository and Workspace configurations. Another alternative would simply be to drop the DOCTYPE declarations from the configuration templates and treat the DTDs as simply manual guidance that you can use with an XML editor. In any case we don t validate the configuration files at runtime so having an exact DOCTYPE doesn t bring that much value.using the public reference and non-validating parser is probably the best. i would leave the doctype references in the configs as guidance for xml editors.Fixed in revisions 493026 and 493031. The public identifier of the DTD is - The Apache Software Foundation DTD Jackrabbit 1.2 EN and I also made the ConfigurationEntityResolver use the local copy of the DTD even if just the system identifier http jackrabbit.apache.org dtd repository-1.2.dtd is used.
