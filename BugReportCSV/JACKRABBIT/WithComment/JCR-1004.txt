SPI Add RepositoryService.getQNodeTypeDefinition
Finding of the F2F 2 3 July similar to recent modifications to the retrieval of name spaces the node type management should be changed in order to only retrieve the complete set of node types on demand. Otherwise single node type definitions should be retrieved as required. To achieve this we agreed to add RepositoryService.getQNodeTypeDefinitionWhile doing this should we rename   getNodeTypeDefinitions to   getQNodeTypeDefinitions I would think so...Revision r554676 added the interface and dummy impls in the various SPI impls throwing RTEs . Angela can you take over to complete the implementations and to make use of it in JCR2SPI rev. 554866 added implementations to spi2jcr spi-rmi and spi2dav next step change jcr2spi in order to make use of the new method instead of retrieving all node type definitions once. in order to let the SPI implementation decide whether the dependencies of a node type definition should be returned as well i changed the method to be Iterator RepositoryService.getQNodeTypeDefinitions SessionInfo QName with rev. 555209 - SPI implementations got adjusted accordingly - JCR2SPI has been changed to load node type definitions on demand.    the only usage for retrieving all definitions at once is a call to NodeTypeManager.getAllNodeTypes    NodeTypeManager.getPrimaryNodeTypes NodeTypeManager.getMixinNodeTypes
