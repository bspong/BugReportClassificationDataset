Lock tokens reains in session after unlock
I do the followin steps node.lock session.getLockTokens - This show the lock token generated by the previous lock. node.unlock session.getLockTokens - Still show me the generated token À À If I unlock a node the token should n be delete from the session correcting type and prioritythe spec doesn t mention whether Node.unlock should remove the token from the session. intuitively i d agree with you that it should be removed.fixed in svn rev. 423488Ok now it works. Thanks Reopened to fix the version tags.
