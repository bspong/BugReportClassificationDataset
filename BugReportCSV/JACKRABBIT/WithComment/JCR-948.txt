Support for JNDI configuration of BundleDbPersistenceManager
It would be nice to have the option to configure BundleDbPersistenceManager database specifying a JNDI name of a DataSource.Attached patch proposal. Connection initialization code extracted to initConnection method. You can configure BundleDbPersistenceManager to use JNDI data source by setting dataSourceLocation parameter otherwise previous way is used. 1 to applying the patch preferably with spaces instead of tabs for indentation and without unnecessarily rearranging the imports My patch solves the problem not only for BundleDbPersistenceManager but also for the DbDataStore. I suggest to use the same mechanism for all modules that require a connection. In this patch no new property is required instead the existing driver and url properties are used To use JNDI the driver class name must reference a javax.naming.Context class for example javax.naming.InitialContext and the URL must be the JNDI URL for example java comp env jdbc Test . If nobody objects I will check in this patch in a few days.Nice I like it Comments It s better if you commit the typo fixes to MySQL and Oracle persistence managers in a separate typos revision Even though it s not strictly related I d wrap the Derby workaround d.newInstance into a try-catch block that simply ignores all exceptions. AFAIK there s no requirement that a JDBC driver class has a public default constructor.Resolved in revision 599371Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 632341.
