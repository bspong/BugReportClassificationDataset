Improve reading of cached UUID for given document number
CachingIndexReader.document int n FieldSelector fieldSelector creates a new Field from the cached UUID. The lucene Field implementation always does a String.intern on the field name which is quite slow. We should probably have our own implementation for that specific use case where we know that the name is already interned. e.g. UUIDField implements Fieldable.Proposed patch. The test case shows that the custom field is 25 times faster.Committed patch in revision 959978The most important part of this issue is not fixed yet. The changed to the CachingIndexReader were not included in the patch.Fixed in revision 1002619
