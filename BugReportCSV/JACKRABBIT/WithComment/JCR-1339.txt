ManageableCollectionUtil doesn t support Maps
ManageableCollectionUtil has two getManageableCollection methods which do not currently return a ManageableCollection which wraps Maps. ManagedHashMap already exists in the codebase which I assume was created for this purpose so both getManageableCollection methods could be modified so that they do something like             if object instanceof Map                 return new ManagedHashMap Map object              An alternative solution might be to modify the JCR mapping to support explicitly defining the ManagedXXX class.Proposed patch to support ManagedHashMapThis patch is not suffisiant because there is a bug in ManagedHashMap. The method addObject uses the Object for the key and for the value. We have to find a solution to set correctly the key.I just commited a better support for the Map there are 2 ways to define a Map attributes Class A For unparametrized Map it is mandatory to define the elementClassName Collection elementClassName Element.class Map map1   For parametized Map the elementClassName is not necessay   Collection private Map String MyClass map2 Furthermore The class ManageableMap is used only internally by the OCM framework.Can you check if it is ok for you
