Allow pseudo properties in query relation
The XPath query parser does not allow using a function name as part of a relation in a query.Fixed in revision 485577I believe this change is incomplete for instance    x and    foo x are parsed into the same query tree.Re-closing this issue. Please open a new issue for any further improvements to avoid confusing the issue tracker. In general it s OK to reopen Resolved issues if something comes up but if an issue is Closed then it would be better to file a new issue as I ve tried to freeze issues by closing them once the related fixes go out in a release. This freezing makes it easier to use the issue tracker to check the release where a specific issue was fixed in.OK.
