Incorrect outer join TCK tests
The TCK test cases for outer joins seem to be incorrect. More specifically the expected result sets for the testRightOuterJoin1 and testLeftOuterJoin2 test cases in EquiJoinConditionTest are invalid as shown below testRightOuterJoin1 result set null n1 n1 n2 n2 n2 The n1 node does not have the propertyName2 property set so the first tuple can never occur regardless of the join type. And since n2 already matches existing nodes even null n2 can not be included in the result set. The correct result set for this query seems to be n1 n2 n2 n2 . testLeftOuterJoin2 result set n1 null n2 n1 n2 n2 Same as above a tuple with n1 as the leftmost node is not possible. The correct result set would be n2 n1 n2 n2 . Unfortunately the correct result sets here don t actually exercise the outer join functionality i.e. none of the nodes in the returned tuples are null. We ll need to modify the test case setup to fix this.I fixed the expected result sets in revision 986682. I ll leave this issue open until we come up with better test cases for outer joins.I merged the above fix to the 2.1 branch in revision 986736.Resolving as fixed. Adding new tests to jcr-tests is a bit troublesome when we don t have a new JCR spec version coming up.
