Simultaneous updates by multiple sessions might not appear in the journal
In a clustering environment simultaneous updates by multiple sessions in the same cluster node might not appear in the journal because only record at a time can be handled by the cluster s workspace-specific callback method. When such a situtation arises the following warnings can be found in the log WARN ClusterNode No record created. WARN ClusterNode No record prepared. Fixed by passing along the current SharedItemStateManager s Update object along with the UpdateEventChannel notifications. This allows the Cluster s workspace-specific callback methods to remember the journal record being appended in the Update object itself. Fixed in revision 516324.
