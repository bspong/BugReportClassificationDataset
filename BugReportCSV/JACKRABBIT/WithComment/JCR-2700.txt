Allow for wildcard restriction in resource-based ACEs
the resourcebased access control model has been extended to allow a single glob restriction to be added for ACEs which works according to the pattern defined by Node getNodes String with the following special cases. any other restriction will be used to determine the exact match to the target path. - no restriction works as before the ACE takes effect on the complete subtree as it used to be before. - an empty string restriction forces the ACE to take effect on the node it has been applied. known limitations - the pattern is a simple string value. it isn t namespace sensitive and makes no attempt to convert the any qualified name fragments   to internal name representations. a restriction my property will be evaluated literally and will never match a my property item   if the corresponding namespace uri gets remapped to some other prefix. - the current implementation has not yet been optimized... this will be covered by JCR-2573
