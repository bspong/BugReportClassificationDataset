TCK DerefQueryLevel1Test requires support for optional jcr deref function
Test fails if jcr deref is not supported. Per JSR-170 jcr deref is optional. Proposal introduce new configuration property which indicates whether jcr deref is supported if not throw NotExecutableException If the implementation throws a RepositoryException when the query is created or executed the test case assumes that the implementation does not support the jcr deref function. svn revision 428408 Thank you for reporting this issue.
