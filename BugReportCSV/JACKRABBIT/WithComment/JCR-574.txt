MsExcelTextFilter throws Exception. Repository is not startable
If i try to add a Excel File see attachment i get this Exception Caused by java.lang.NumberFormatException You cannot get a string value from a numeric cell at org.apache.poi.hssf.usermodel.HSSFCell.getStringCellValue HSSFCell.java 800 at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.MsExcelTextFilter 1.initializeReader MsExcelTextFilter.java 97 at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.LazyReader.read LazyReader.java 79 The bad news is that if you add this file the repository is not startabel anymore because the file is in the redo.log and you get a blocker The stack from the restart after NumberFormatException 19.09.2006 08 47 23 ERROR RepositoryImpl Unable to start repository forcing shutdown... 19.09.2006 08 47 23 INFO RepositoryImpl Shutting down repository... 19.09.2006 08 47 23 INFO RepositoryImpl shutting down workspace default ... 19.09.2006 08 47 23 INFO ObservationManagerFactory Notification of EventListeners stopped. 19.09.2006 08 47 23 INFO RepositoryImpl workspace default has been shutdown I think its very important that you can not block a whole repository if the indexer throws a exception. thanks clausA sample xls file that produces the exception ...Fixed the LazyReader class to also catch runtime exceptions when initializing the reader from the text filter implementation. Fixed in revision 454360 of the text filter module. Thank you for reporting this issue. Please note that you can work around this issue by temporarily disable the text filters when restarting jackrabbit. Well it s not a real workaround because you ll get into this issue again when a similar excel file is uploaded and the text filters are enabled.
