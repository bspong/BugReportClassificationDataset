Move SimpleWebdavServlet to jcr-server and make it abstract
In line with isse JCR-417 I suggest to partially move the SimpleWebdavServlet from the jcr-webapp project to the jcr-server project. By partially I mean that the new moved servlet will be abstract and the getRepository method will be abstract. The jcr-webapp project will still contain a SimpleWebdavServlet for backwards compatibility maintaing the same name which just extends the new servlet and implements the getRepository method using the RepositoryAccess servlet. This allows for the reuse of the jcr-server project including the abstract SimpleWebdavServlet in other environments. My intention is to include this project along with the webdav project in Sling. Will provide a patch for this proposal This issue is separated out of JCR-1262 as suggested by Angela Patch to the jackrabbit-jcr-server and jackrabbit-webapp project implementing the changes     - Copy SimpleWebdavServlet to jackrabbit-jcr-server project     - Make getRepository method and whole class abstract     - Remove setRepository method and private repository field     - Remove all methods and fields except private repository field and       setRepository and getRepository methods from the old SimpleWebdavServlet     - Have the old SimpleWebdavServlet extend the new abstract SimpleWebdavServletfine with me. do you want to commit it or should i and would it make sense to do the same for the JCRWebdavServerServlet what do yo think I can do that just wanted to wait for your OK. And yes it would definitely make sense for the JCRWebdavServerServlet too. Will create an issue and implement the fix at the same time.Fixed in Rev.603178.This issue implements part of JCR-417.Schedule for 1.4
