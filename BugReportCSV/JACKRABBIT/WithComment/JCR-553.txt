problem in jcr-server project.properties dependencies 
There seems to be a mismatch in the version numbers in the dependencies defined in jcr-server project.properties. It refers to version 1.0 yet the other components are already at 1.1. The attached patch solves the problem for me but I don t claim to fully understand how this works... I agree the version in the project.properties is wrong. Applied the patch in revision 439039 Thank you for reporting this issue.
