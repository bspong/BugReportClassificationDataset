Path.equals does not work for other Path implementations
PathImpl.equals does not take other path implementations into account likely a typo .Fixed with revision 607075. Is there a use case where two differnt path implementations are tested for equality. If not I d rather suggest to keep the previous check for PathImpl. Not doing so will likely cause problems when there are implementations that extend from PathImpl.Of course there are. One of the reasons for the introduction of the new APIs was to allow implementations to use custom Name Path implementations. In particular for some implementations it will be more efficient to store prefix localName others will prefer namespace localname .
