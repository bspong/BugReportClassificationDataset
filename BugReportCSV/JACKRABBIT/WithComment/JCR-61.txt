Docview import fails if attribute and childelem have same name
docimport fails if element has same name as one of the attributes of its parent element. example xml version 1.0 encoding UTF-8 feature plugin foobar      plugin test plugin feature importing this results in a ItemExistsException plugin this is a specification issue. the specification should be clear about how such a name collision property and child node with same name should be resolved in Document View XML import.i was wrong this is not a specification issue. quote from the specification 7.3.2 Import from Document View ... 10. An XML element can have a child element and an attribute with the same name while a JCR node cannot have a child node and property with the same name. For example a b x b a would imply a JCR node with one property called b and one child node also called b which is not allowed. Therefore if such a fragment of XML is encountered on import it is an implementation issue as to how to deal with it. so the current behaviour ItemExistsException is accordance with the spec is an implementation issue as to how to deal with it . but i guess we will have to come up with a way to import such xml fragments e.g. with a child node construct that represents a colliding property similar to jcr xmltext for character data changing priority to minor as current behaviour is compliant with specificationfixed in rev. 190588 conflicting attribute will be imported using an escaped name
