Mandatory authentication prevents webdav client connections
As seen on the mailing list java -jar target jackrabbit-standalone-2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar cli http localhost 8080 Exception in thread main javax.jcr.RepositoryException Unable to access a repository with the following settings    org.apache.jackrabbit.repository.uri http localhost 8080 The following RepositoryFactory classes were consulted    org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2dav.Jcr2davRepositoryFactory declined    org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.Jcr2spiRepositoryFactory declined    org.apache.jackrabbit.commons.JndiRepositoryFactory declined    org.apache.jackrabbit.core.RepositoryFactoryImpl declined    org.apache.jackrabbit.rmi.repository.RmiRepositoryFactory failed        because of RepositoryException Failed to read the resource at URL http localhost 8080        because of IOException Server returned HTTP response code 401 for URL http localhost 8080 Perhaps the repository you are trying to access is not available at the moment.        at org.apache.jackrabbit.commons.JcrUtils.getRepository JcrUtils.java 216        at org.apache.jackrabbit.commons.JcrUtils.getRepository JcrUtils.java 256        at org.apache.jackrabbit.standalone.Main.run Main.java 127        at org.apache.jackrabbit.standalone.Main.main Main.java 61 Fixed in revision 1173118 by allowing the webdav client to continue without repository descriptors if accessing them would require authentication. A more complete fix would also modify the webdav server to always allow repository descriptor report requests without authentication but that would require non-trivial changes to the way requests are currently being processed in the webdav server. Doing that would allow clients to access repository descriptors even if repository access otherwise is blocked only to authenticated clients. Let s handle that as a possible followup issue.
