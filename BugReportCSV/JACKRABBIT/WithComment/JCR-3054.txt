Deprecate RepositoryService.getPropertyInfo method
I would like to deprecate and ultimately remove the RepositoryService.getPropertyInfo method and extend RepositoryService.getItemInfos to take over that functionality. getItemInfos would thus change to            Method used to batch-read from the persistent storage. It returns the       code ItemInfo code for the given code ItemId code as the first       element in the code Iterator code . In addition the iterator may contain       arbitrary code ItemInfo code s.           public Iterator extends ItemInfo getItemInfos SessionInfo sessionInfo ItemId itemId throws ItemNotFoundException RepositoryException Tentative patchtentative patchi am fine with deprecating the method. the only thing that i was thinking of was the question of the same-name node property feature which is allowed since jcr 283. this used to be a problem in the jcr-remoting since on the server-side there - up to now - no possibility to distinguish them path-wise. see JCR-1616 ... but since the spi-ItemID itself is sufficient to avoid any ambiguity the proposed solution should not do any harm au contraire .
