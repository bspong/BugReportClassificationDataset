Indexing configuration ignored when indexing length
The NodeIndexer does not respect the indexing configuration when it adds a field for the property length. NodeIndexer.addValue Document doc InternalValue value Name name should check it the property actually needs to be indexed.Attached path. I also took the liberty to remove some unnecessary casts from the code. This is going to suck a little bit because it contains also the changes submitted for JCR-2916. I d rather submit twice the same changes than submit this patch without those changes and making it possible to overwrite the changes for the other patch. I guess this falls under growing painsPatch committed in revision 1089053. Thanks Merged to the 2.2 branch in revision 1095660.
