Add configuration path to SynonymProvider
This is an enhancement to the SynonymProvider which will be included in the 1.4 release. The current interface only has a getSynonyms method but does not allow to initialize the SynonymProvider. It should be possible to initialize the provider with a configuration file. The configuration may then include the synonym definitions or a pointer to a location where the synonyms are defined. The configuration will be implementation dependent. In addition there should be a simple default implementation in jackrabbit-core. The wordnet-synonyms in the sandbox are only of limited use and must be built manually.Added method SynonymProvider.initialize FileSystemResource . jackrabbit-core now also includes a simple implementation that uses a properties file to define synonyms org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.PropertiesSynonymProvider svn revision 606180Adapted adapted wordnet-synonyms in sandbox accordingly.Fixed an issue with relative paths on linux systems. svn revision 606218
