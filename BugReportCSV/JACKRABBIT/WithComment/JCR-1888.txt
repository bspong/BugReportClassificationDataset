Add customizable filtering to GQL
Currently GQL is not very flexible because it does not have any hooks that allows you to modify the query that gets generated from the GQL syntax. As a first step I d like to introduce a filtering mechanism that can be used to post process the result set and exclude certain rows. This is useful when you cannot express an application constraint in GQL.Implemented in revision 722068 Added integration test cases to jackrabbit-core in revision 722069
