Missing support for lock timeout and ownerHint in jcr-server
trying to set the lock timeout when creating a lock seems not to work over the davex transport. the timeout is always 2147483. this was my test code import javax.jcr. import javax.jcr.lock. import org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.RepositoryImpl import org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.config.RepositoryConfig String url http localhost 8080 server String workspace tests RepositoryConfig config new RepositoryConfigImplTest repoUrl Repository repo RepositoryImpl.create config Credentials sc new SimpleCredentials admin admin .toCharArray Session s repo.login sc workspace Node t if s.getRootNode .hasNode test     t s.getRootNode .getNode test else     t s.getRootNode .addNode test nt unstructured t.addMixin mix lockable s.save LockManager m s.getWorkspace .getLockManager Lock l m.lock t.getPath false true 10 me System.out.println l.getSecondsRemaining and the output is 2147483 the relevant communication fragment is below i attach the full trace in case i miss something.

Could you please open a separate ticket
