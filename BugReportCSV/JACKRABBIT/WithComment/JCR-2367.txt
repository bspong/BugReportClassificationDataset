RepositoryCopier does not copy open-scoped Locks
If you use the RepositoryCopier to make a backup of your repository and you have open-scoped not session scoped locks these locks will not be copied. If you try to restore your copy of the repository all locks are gone.I have already mailed this issue to the user mailing list and Jukka Zitting does know the problem. Is it possible to get a patch for the problem because it is very critical to us. When will be Jackrabbit 1.6.1 released Maybe we can switch to that version.Fixed in revision 830575 and merged to the 1.6 branch in revision 830650. There s not yet a fixed schedule for the 1.6.1 release but I think we should do it soon as we already have quite a few fixes lined up for it.
