SQL Azure support clustered indexes
We tried to install JackRabbit in the Windows Azure cloud using SQL Azure. One of the limitations of SQL Azure is that it needs clustered indexes to work but the current implementation of the JackRabbit creates the indexes not clustered.SQL script that works on SQL AzureCould you turn that into DDL template files like the ones you can find in jackrabbit-core src main resources org apache jackrabbit core persistence bundle and jackrabbit-core src main resources org apache jackrabbit core fs db I ve added resources.rar with 4 .ddl files called azure.dll and 1 properties file called azure.properties. I could not find a testclass to use as a template to test the output of the ddl when the placeholders are replaced so I haven t tested it. I copied the mssql.ddl to use as a template and made all the indexes clustered and I removed the tablespace placeholder because SQL Azure doesn t like the whole ON ... stuff.Looks good thanks I note that you didn t check the Grant license to ASF box when attaching the files. Is it OK for us to include these files in Jackrabbit as described in the Apache license Ah sorry sure you can include those files.Perfect thanks I committed the new schema files in revision 1070917.
