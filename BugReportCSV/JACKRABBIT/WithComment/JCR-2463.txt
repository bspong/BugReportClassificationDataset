Minor spi2dav ExceptionConverter improvements
It would be nice if the ExceptionConverter class in spi2dav returned UnsupportedRepositoryOperationExceptions instead of the undeclared UnsupportedOperationExceptions for HTTP 501 responses. Besides that the ExceptionConverter.generate methods should be cleaned to always return the generated exception instead of in some cases returning and in others throwing it. Finally there s some unused code and chances for Java 5 cleanups. I ll attach a patch and commit it unless anyone objects.applied patch typo was already addressed with changes made for JCR-2509 Revision 915358 NOTE the subversion integration reports that this issue was merged into the 2.0 branch in Rev. 898773... i think there was a typo in the svn msg.
