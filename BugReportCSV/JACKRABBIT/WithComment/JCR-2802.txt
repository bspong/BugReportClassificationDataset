Deprecate all non-bundle persistence managers
Bundle persistence has been the recommended default since Jackrabbit 1.3 and there is little reason for anyone to be using non-bundle persistence anymore. Thus I d like to deprecate all non-bundle PMs in Jackrabbit 2.2 and target for their removal in Jackrabbit 3.0. 1 Would that just be in the source code or do you intend to also log some kind of warning when a non-bundle PM is still in use in 2.2 I was thinking of deprecating them in the source code and any relevant documentation and mentioning this in the 2.2 release notes. A log warning would be a nice extra. 1 1 1 1I deprecated all the non-bundle persistence managers in revision 1032784. In revision 1032787 I added a generic mechanism that logs warnings for all kinds of deprecated configuration entries.What about the InMemPersistenceManager I do not see a replacement for it in the o.a.j.c.persistence.bundle package.
