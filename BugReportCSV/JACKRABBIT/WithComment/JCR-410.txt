JCR-Server Code depends on Log4J directly
The code is written against the Log4J APIs which forces all users of Jackarabbit to pick up log4J dependency and to juggle with JDK logging and Log4J configuration if other components of the project uses JDK 1.4 logging. If the code is move to depend on Apache commons-logging this issue will be resolved. Also this should be a minor fix.Shouldn t this actually be slf4j instead of commons-logging as the rest of JCR has gone that way of course - i just copy-pasted the original text from issue JCR-215 without reading it - fixed. Committed revision 396547.
