Inconsistency when version with a label is removed
While executing random operations on the version storage I came across a situation where a version is removed that has a version label. The current behaviour in jackrabbit is IMO not correct because the version node gets removed but the version label is still present in the version history. This means there is a referenceable property that points to nowhere. So I guess either - the version label property must be removed as well when the version is removed or - the remove version operation should fail because the version is still referenced I wasn t able to find a relevant section in the spec though I must admit that I don t know the versioning section that well.Added test case which is not enabled to run because it fails org.apache.jackrabbit.core.version.RemoveVersionLabelTestLabel cache was not updated when version is removed. Fixed in revision 637946Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 638052.
