DBFileSystem MySQL DDL not compatible with pre-5.0 versions
The packaged ddl for mysql index sizes is too large for 4.x versions of MySQL. As the sum-total of the index sizes may only reach 500. So create unique index schemaObjectPrefix FSENTRY IDX on schemaObjectPrefix FSENTRY FSENTRY PATH 745 FSENTRY NAME will not work. I would suggest shortening the FSENTRY PATH index value to 245 as FSENTRY NAME is already set to 255. create unique index schemaObjectPrefix FSENTRY IDX on schemaObjectPrefix FSENTRY FSENTRY PATH 245 FSENTRY NAME now that s what i call a fast coding-testing cycle thanks roy fixed as suggested r348455 .
