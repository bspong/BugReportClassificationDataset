remove dependencies of XPathQueryBuilder on core Jackrabbit code
The XPath query parser currently has a single dependency on SearchManager for the sole purpose of importing two namespace URIs for XML Schema and XPath 2.0 functions . This makes it harder than it should be to use it stand-alone. I propose to copy the two namespace URIs into XPathQueryBuilder getting rid of the dependency. Proposed patch. Applied the patch. svn revision 426448 Thank you for the suggestion.Oops. My patch failed to remove the import statement for SearchManager. Removed the statement. svn revision 426457
