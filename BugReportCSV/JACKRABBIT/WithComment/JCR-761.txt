JCA build failure with J2EE 1.3
The fix to JCR-736 introduced a similar problem as was previously reported in JCR-413. The fix in JCR-413 should apply also to this case.Fixed in revision 510468.In Class JCAManagedConnection the Method public void cleanup throws ResourceException     synchronized handles     try       this.session.refresh false      catch RepositoryException e       throw new ResourceException unable to cleanup connection e          this.handles.clear    A ResourceException wil be thrown with given Exception. Can you please fix this also .. thanks clausGood point fixed in revision 410576. Is there a good Maven dependency we could use instead of the following to catch these issues at compile-time      dependency        groupId org.apache.geronimo.specs groupId        artifactId geronimo-j2ee-connector 1.5 spec artifactId        version 1.0 version        scope provided scope      dependency
