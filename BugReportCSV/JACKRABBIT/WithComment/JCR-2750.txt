MultiStatusResponse should not call resource.getProperties
current constructor MultiStatusResponse calls resource.getProperties even if propFindType PROPFIND BY PROPERTY. This is inconvenient because some properties are expensive to generate if they are not requested. MultiStatusResponse constructor with parameter PROPFIND BY PROPERTY should do if propFindType PROPFIND BY PROPERTY   for propName propNameSet     prop resource.getProperty propName     if prop null       status200.addContent prop     else       status404.addContent propName    else   ... Sounds good to me. Could you formulate the above as a proper patch against the latest Jackrabbit trunk Fixed in revision 1000414.Thank you this issue was a duplicate of JCR-397 will be resolved as duplicate . Note however the fix will not prevent the expensive properties to be calculated due to the current implementation of DavResource getProperty as i stated in JCR-397     Note The current implementation s of the DavResource build the complete property set even     if only a single property is accessed. This should be reviewed as well.
