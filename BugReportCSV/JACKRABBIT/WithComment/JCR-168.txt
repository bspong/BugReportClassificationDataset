Observation events are not triggered for intermediate nodes in version storage
When a new version history is created no observation events are triggered for the intermediate nodes. E.g. for the VersionHistory d94d4b41-f68e-4586-9e88-96e6790981d8 the following events are triggered with a node filter applied property events are not visible Node added jcr system jcr versionStorage d9 4d 4b d94d4b41-f68e-4586-9e88-96e6790981d8 Node added jcr system jcr versionStorage d9 4d 4b d94d4b41-f68e-4586-9e88-96e6790981d8 jcr versionLabels Node added jcr system jcr versionStorage d9 4d 4b d94d4b41-f68e-4586-9e88-96e6790981d8 jcr rootVersion Node added jcr system jcr versionStorage d9 4d 4b d94d4b41-f68e-4586-9e88-96e6790981d8 jcr rootVersion jcr frozenNode Observation should also trigger node added events for jcr system jcr versionStorage d9 jcr system jcr versionStorage d9 4d jcr system jcr versionStorage d9 4d 4bfixed rev 219336The VersionManagerImpl now always triggers three add node events for the intermediate nodes. After a certain amount of VersionHistory nodes are created the VersionManagerImpl triggers add node events for nodes that already existed.fixed again...
