Make behaviour configurable when re-indexing detects workspace inconsistency
Currently the query handler throws an exception and the repository will not start. There are multiple options how to deal with this situation 1 fail and repository startup will fail 2 ignore and proceed 3 fix the inconsistency and proceed 1 and 2 can be implemented quite easily. with the recent enhancement JCR-1428 3 can also be implemented with reasonable effort. In any case an error message should be written to the log.After some reconsideration I decided to only implement the first option. I think an inconsistency should always trigger some manual intervention and with the newly added consistency fix JCR-1428 this is now possible. Which means for now this is basically about turning JCR-1326 in a more manageable form. svn revision 648691Changed visibility of OnWorkspaceInconsistency constructor to protected. svn revision 648707Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 650539.
