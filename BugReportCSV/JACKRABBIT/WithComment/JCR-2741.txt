Improved logging for session operations
I d like to add the following logging features to SessionOperations Use MDC 1 to make it possible to filter and redirect logs based on which session is being used Add simple debug-level timing information for executed SessionOperations to help pinpoint performance issues Classify SessionOperations as read or write operations and log warnings instead of the current debug messages for concurrent writes on a session 1 http logback.qos.ch manual mdc.htmlThe MDC variables jcr.session and jcr.operation are now set while session operations are being performed. I ve also implemented the other improvements mentioned above. Resolving as fixed.I had to revert the MDC variables from session operations as they were adding too much overhead especially to small reads. See revision 997685.
