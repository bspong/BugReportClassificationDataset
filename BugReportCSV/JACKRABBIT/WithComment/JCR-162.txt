bad project.xml
project.xml in the api module actually contains an error nested comment and can t be read by maven.this is the trivial patchFixed in revision 209310. It s strange that my Maven installation reported no problems about this. Could this be some weird corner case in the XML parser Anyhow I actually solved the problem by removing the entire comment section that referenced to the previous 0.16.4.1 version of the JCR API. Many thanks Fabrizio for reporting this It s strange that my Maven installation reported no problems about this. Could this be some weird corner case in the XML parser the error was only reported by Maven 1.1... the project.xml parser in 1.0 it s a lot more permissive... the error was only reported by Maven 1.1... the project.xml parser in 1.0 it s a lot more permissive... OK that explains.
