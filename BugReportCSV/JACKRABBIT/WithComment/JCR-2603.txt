DefaultLoginModule performs anonymous login in case of unsupported Credentials implementation
If Repository.login in called with an unsupported Credentials implementation the DefaultLoginModule getCredentials returns null and thus an anonymous login. The expected behavior from my point of view however was that login with unsupported credentials would not be handled by the LoginModule and - if no other module is able to handle it - login would consequently fails.moved the test for supported credentials from AbstractLoginModule getCredentials to the calling login method.
