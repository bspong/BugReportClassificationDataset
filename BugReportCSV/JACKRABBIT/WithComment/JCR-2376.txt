Add basic I O counters to query handler
There should be a couple of simple counters that track the number of I O operations that are performed during a query execution. This will help debug query performance issues.Implemented in revision 831865 There are currently two read counts available in the debug log for QueryResultImpl - number of reads to execute the query - number of reads to retrieve result set Sample log messages QueryResultImpl query executed in 0 ms 72 QueryResultImpl retrieved ScoreNodes in 0 ms 13 The number in brackets are the number of reads from the index files.
