spi2dav Overwrite header T specified for MOVE and COPY causes failure if some API tests
failing tests are org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.WorkspaceCopySameNameSibsTest testCopyNodesNodeExistsAtDestPath org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.WorkspaceMoveSameNameSibsTest testMoveNodesNodeExistsAtDestPath those would be fixed by setting the overwrite header to F alse ... however this doesn t fit those cases where same-same siblings would be allowed and the copy move to a destination with existing item would succeed in JCR.changed overwrite header to F and adjusted the copy move operation in the servlet in order NOT to fail in case of existing destination including some comments why this is required for the remoting although not in accordance with the RFC. in addition added a test to jackrabbit-jcr-test for copying twice with SNS-enabled at the destination checking if this results in 2 child nodes. this didn t work with the overwrite header T either as the existing node got removed...
