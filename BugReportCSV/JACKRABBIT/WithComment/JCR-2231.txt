Avoid item state reads during Session.logout 
Local item states are discarded during Session.logout . Currently the CachingHierarchyManager is still registered as a item state listener at that time and will cause numerous ItemStateManager.hasItemState calls. This is unnecessary and just adds overhead to the logout call. In addition it will also contribute to a potential lock contention on the SharedItemStateManager.Proposed patch. 1 for the patch thanks Applied patch in revision 798940Merged to the 1.x branch in revision 801132.
