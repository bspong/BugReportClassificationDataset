Improved XML export handling
As mentioned in JCR-1574 the current XML export functionality is generating workarounds like the new PropertyWrapper class. I d like to refactor and clean up the XML export stuff so that such workarounds wouldn t be needed. An additional bonus would be to make both core and jcr2spi use the same XML export mechanism. For example the one in core already supports JSR 283 shareable nodes but the one in jcr2spi does not.Attached a patch export.patch that moves all the XML export functionality from core to jcr-commons. The jcr-commons implementation is a heavily refactored version of the previous functionality. The refactoring noticeably reduces the amount of code involved and increases the documentation of the relevant classes. I ll see if I could make also jcr2spi use the same functionality note that I failed the last time I tried to do that .Updated version of the patch now it covers also jcr2spi. The refactoring and removed duplication results in nice reduction in the lines of code from 1240 to 414 Empty lines and comments excluded. Committed in revisions 656194 jcr-commons 656195 core and 656199 jcr2spi .
