Upgrade to latest Apache parent POM
We re quite a bit behind the latest and greatest of the Apache parent POMs org.apache apache mostly since we re inheriting it through the now mostly unused org.apache.jackrabbit parent POM. I d like to move things back from the o.a.j parent POM to the jackrabbit-parent POM that s located inside trunk. This will allow us to upgrade to the latest Apache parent POM without the trouble of an extra release of the o.a.j parent POM.Done in revisions 1157043 1157044 1157062 and 1157063.
