Add a way to locate full text extraction problems
Full text indexing of a binary document can fail for various reasons. Currently we just log a generic error message in such cases which makes it difficult for the user to locate such problems for review and reindexing. We should improve this by making the logs more informative or by adding some other mechanism for locating troublesome documents.Fixed in revision 1085038 by adding a special TextExtractionError token to the index for any binary property for which text extraction failed. Also reduced the severity of log messages about extraction failures.So if I search for TextExtractionError should return all the binary properties which failed to be indexed Exactly.Great I was missing this feature for years At least now I can see which document were not indexed. Is also possible to make a relation between the document and the text extraction error Yes to the search index such documents look like simple text documents that contain just the string TextExtractionError . You can query for that token and include any other constraints path etc. just like when searching for normal documents. PS. In revision 1085050 I excluded extraction errors caused by linkage problems from being reported. They are caused by required extraction libraries not being present which is a configuration deployment choice instead of any inherent problems with the documents being parsed.
