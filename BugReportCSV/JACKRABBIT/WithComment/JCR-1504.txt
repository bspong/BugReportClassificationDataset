MS Excel Mime Type missing in MsExcelTextExtractor
The MsExcelTextExtractor listens to mime type application vnd.ms-excel but storing excels will result in mime type application msexcel too. Such tagged files will not be indexed by the MsExcelTextExtractor. The class should register itself to both mime types like the MsWordTextExtractor does.Trivial patch implementing the suggested fix.The patch does not work. There must be an individual String for each mime type. Besides application msexcel is not a valid IANA mime type whereas application vnd.ms-excel. We should therefore actually change the mapping in jackrabbit-jcr-server. But I m OK with adding the mime type to MsExcelTextExtractor as well.Fixed in jackrabbit-jcr-server 642174 and jackrabbit-text-extractors 642177 The patch does not work. There must be an individual String for each mime type. Silly me. Sorry for the trouble. Thanks for fixing this.
