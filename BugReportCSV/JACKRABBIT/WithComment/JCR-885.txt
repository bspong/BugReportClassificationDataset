BundlePersistenceManager.externalBLOBs can not be configured
If you try to configure the property externalBLOBs through the workspace.xml it does not work. The BundlePersistenceManager has not Method setExternalBLOBs boolean externalBLOBs so it can not be configured because its not bean conform. See the DatabasePersistenceManager which has such a Method Is this really an omission or externalBLOBs is left read-only and false on purpose I will post the patch if former is the case.I think this is a ommision. you can find the bean methods on the old perisistence managers. BR clausalright. thanx.i will post the patch then.both getter and accessor are already there in 1.3 branch. see lines 290 onwards.Yes there is a setter but it takes a string as param and this is not bean confrom. This patch adds a method with a setter that takes a boolean. See equivalent line 178 in org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.db.DatabasePersistenceManager BR clausPatch applied in revision 540933. I also removed the String setter. Thanks for the fix and sorry for the delay in applying it Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 544297.
