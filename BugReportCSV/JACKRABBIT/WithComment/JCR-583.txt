TCK NodeReadMethodsTest.testGetName fails with NPE if testroot has no child node
The testGetName does not assert that the childnode field has been populated during setup. if for whatever reason the test data don t provide a single childnode below the test root this test will fail with nullpointer exception. i would like to suggest to use the same assertion as in testGetPath and throw a NotExecutableException in case of missing child node. patch attached. patch for this issue. btw testGetName initially tests if the root node s name is . This is already covered by RootNodeTest.testGetName and i would rather not mix this into the testGetName case which states in the JavaDoc that the last segment of the path and the name are being compared. For this reason i removed the additional test for the root node in the patch.Fixed in revision 480975 Thanks a lot for the patch.
