The jackrabbit-ocm DTD 1.5 is missing and has to be publish
The jackrabbit-ocm DTD 1.5 is missing and it should be made available for reference on the Jackrabbit web site.I don t recall if I already gave the instructions but here they are again. - To publish static files to our website just commit them to the jackrabbit site folder in svn from where they will automatically be deployed to the public web site. See http jackrabbit.apache.org website.html for the details.Thanks Jukka for the info. The OCM 1.5 has beed added into the website. It will available from http jackrabbit.apache.org dtd This may take some time before seeing it on the site.
