Add getPath method to Authorizable interface
currently the only way to retrieve the path of the item associated with an authorizable is to check if the principal obtained through Authorizable getPrincipal is an ItemBasedPrincipal. having a getPath method would provide a convenient shortcut and would in addition allow to determine of there is really an item associated with a authorizable that is accessible for the editing session which is not necessarily the case for ItemBasedPrincipal getPathadded method to interface and to the implementation in jackrabbit core. the method returns the path of the node associated with the authorizable if it is accessible to the editing session same workspace and otherwise throws UnsupportedRepositoryOperationException
