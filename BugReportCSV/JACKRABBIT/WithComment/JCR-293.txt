Property.setValue InputStream closes stream
Currently the Property.setValue InputStream - actually all methods setting a property value from an InputStream - method closes the stream when it has completely been read. While this might be a nice-to-have in some situations it is IMHO not standard behaviour for stream consumers to close the stream when done. My special use case is unpacking the contents of a ZIP file ZIPInputStream . After streaming the contents of the first ZIP file entry into a property the ZIPInputStream is closed by Jackrabbit and the rest of the file cannot be read. Workaround Instead of giving the original InputStream to the method create a FileInputStream wrapper overwriting the close method to do nothing. 1 to not close the stream in Property.setValue InputStream I don t really use binary properties so I haven t run into this issue but my natural instinct would be to write code like this     InputStream stream ...     try         property.setValue stream      finally         stream.close      fixed in svn r357013
