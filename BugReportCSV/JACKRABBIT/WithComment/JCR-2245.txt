Make QValueFactoryImpl extensible
The class is currently final and other modules therefore copied code. This kind of duplication it hard to maintain and should be avoided. If QValueFactoryImpl would be designed to be extensible then other classes could reuse much of the code.Proposed patch with the following changes - all create methods except binary related moved from QValueFactoryImpl to AbstractQValueFactory - promoted QValueImpl in QValueFactoryImpl to a top level class - DefaultQValue - spi-commons now has a dependency to io-commons New version of the patch. the previous wasn t binary compatible with existing code in jackrabbit-core.Applied patch in revision 802695
