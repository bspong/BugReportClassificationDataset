Support synonym searches
Jackrabbit should support synonym searches in the jcr contains function like Google does. Example element nt resource jcr contains . food - finds all nt resource nodes that contain the word food or synonyms for food.Since it s a new feature it doesn t really have an affected version...Added an interface that allows to plug in a custom SynonymProvider. Committed in revision 536247Added a SynonymProvider implementation that uses WordNet to get synonyms for a search term. See contrib wordnet-synonyms Please note that this contrib requires some manual steps to build the jar file More information can be found in the README.txt file. Committed in revision 536250Instead of bundling the synonym database in the jar file I think it would make more sense to add a configuration entry for a user to indicate which file in the deployment environment contains the synonym database. I guess the current configuration mechanism doesn t allow making such entries easily pluggable for alternative synonym mechanisms...In general I agree. The problem I had was that I didn t know how to supply a parameter to a parameter and my intention was to make the wordnet synonym provider deployment as easy as possible. How about this - add a new parameter synonymProviderOptions - Extend the SynonymProvider interface with an init method that passes in the options string
