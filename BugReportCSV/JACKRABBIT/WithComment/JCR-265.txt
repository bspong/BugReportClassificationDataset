Bug with textfilters and classloaders
I m having problems with text filter service. I built the contrib textfilters package and I included the resulting jackrabbit-textfilters-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in my application classpath. The problem is that TextFilterService class is unable to find any filters even though that a services org...TextFilterService file is wihin the META-INF jar s directory. I think that this must to be with Eclipse RCP classloader mechanism but the fact is that it does not work. I find a little bit strange this way to load services and as you can see it seems problematic in some scenarios.

Using the service registry does not seem to work stable enough with context classloaders.
