BundleFsPersistenceManager remove deprecated settings
Some settings of the BundleFsPersistenceManager are not used internally and should be removed blobFSInitialCache blobFSMaximumCache itemFSBlockSize itemFSInitialCache itemFSMaximumCacheFixed in revision 600468Should we keep the setters as no-op methods that just log a warning There might be installations out there that use those configuration options and I d prefer not to break them.The settings were not used that means it didn t have any effect if somebody used them. Things will not break now that they are removed any parameter in the repository.xml that doesn t have a setter in the class is ignored. Including misspelled parameters. Actually in my view this behavior is not desirable what do you think Ah you re right about missing setters just being ignored. I guess the best option would be to make BeanConfig log a warning for all such configuration parameters. I ll file a separate issue for that.
