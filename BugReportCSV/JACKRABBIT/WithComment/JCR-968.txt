Add support for tablespaces to Oracle related classes
When a user account for an Oracle database has no or a temporary default tablespace then the appropriate database schemas cannot be created. This is an issue for at least the following packages - o.a.j.core.persistence.bundle - o.a.j.core.persistence.db - o.a.j.core.fs.db Attached is a patch that provides a possible solution.Looks good to me. Thanks for the contribution The only problem I have with the patch is that it doesn t apply cleanly to svn trunk. Note that we ve recently moved resources to src main resources and also the BundleDbPersistenceManager class has seen some changes recently. Could you update the patch to match latest sources the patch affects the generic BundleDbPersistenceManager class. since the suggested change is oracle-specific i suggest to apply the changes to OraclePersistenceManager instead.I created the previous patch on the 1.3 release. This patch is created on the trunk and includes an additional fix for the o.a.j.c.journal package. Furthermore I addressed Stefan s comment by creating a new method that constructs the SQL string and by overriding that method in the Oracle-specific subclasses. This also gives less code duplication. 1 for the second patch excellent Patch applied in revision 558187. Thanks
