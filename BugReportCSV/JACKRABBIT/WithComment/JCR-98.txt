extensibility patch for simple WebDAV servlet
attaching a patch that makes the simple WebDAV servlet more extensible - subclasses can now provide their own support objects such as DavResourceFactory and DavLocatorFactory. also patches DavResourceImpl to make importXml and importFile methods protected for subclass use. hi brian thanks for the patch. i included the modifications for WebdavServlet with one single adjustment calling getLockManager instead of using the lockMgr field when creating the default resource factory . however i did not change the access modifiers as you suggested in DavResourceImpl... i m not so happy with the 2 methods anyway and would prefer some sort of import-handler. regards angela
