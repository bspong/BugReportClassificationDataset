QueryManagerImpl hardwires supported query languages
QueryManagerImpl hardwires supported query languages. This seems to be sub-optimal given the fact that Jackrabbit has a pluggable architecture for additional query languages. Any ideas on how to make the implementation extensible A configuration option like the one used for index filters I guess that would require extending QueryTreeBuilder with a method that returns all supported languages such as   Set getSupportedLanguages or   String getSupportedLanguages . QueryTreeBuilderRegistry could then be extended in a similar way making the information visible inside Jackrabbit. Patch as proposed in previous comment. Applied patch with minor formatting changes. svn revision 428267 Thank you for the patch.
