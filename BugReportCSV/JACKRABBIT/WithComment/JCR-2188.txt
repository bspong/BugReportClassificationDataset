Parallelize tests
As mentioned on the mailing list I d like to parallelize test execution. There will be a pool of RepositoryHelper instances each represents a distinct repository. This ensures that test cases that run in parallel do not interfere with each other. I suggest we start with a pool of two repositories but we can later extend this setup.Some of the longer running tests including JCRAPITest now extend frrom ConcurrentTestSuite. This reduces the time to run the tests to 60-70 . Implemented in revision 791253
