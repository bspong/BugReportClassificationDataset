Speed up NodeIndexer.isIndexed check
The isIndexed method is called for every value in a multi-valued property. This may be quite expensive when there are a lot of values.The proposed patch moves up the isIndexed call from the addValue method to createDoc. Before it was being called for each value of a property so for a MVP multiple times which is suboptimal because the method only relates to the property s name not its value to determine if it should be indexed or not.Fixed in rev 1241384.It looks like the code could be simplified by moving the isIndexed conditional right up to the createDoc method. The only complication seems to be the handling of jcr primaryType and jcr mixinTypes properties but I think we can cover that by making the isIndexed method always return true for those names.Made the suggested change in revision 1241418. 1 the code looks cleaner now
