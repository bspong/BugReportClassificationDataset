EventConsumer.canRead should rely on AccessManager.isGranted 
The current implementation of EventConsumer.canRead uses AccessManager.canRead which might cause issues if the item does not exist anymore. AccessManager.isGranted explicitly mentions and supports checks on paths for items that do not yet exist or not exist anymore. See also JCR-3271.Fixed in revision 1303913backported to 2.4 with revision 1346878.
