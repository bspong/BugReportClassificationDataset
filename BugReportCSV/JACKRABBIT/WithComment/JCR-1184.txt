Introduce spellchecker functionality based on content in the workspace
Provide a way to spell check a fulltext statement based on the content present in the workspace.I saw some mails on this issue specifically Would there be interest within the Lucene team to include the feature in a future release of lucene-core . Probably really trivial to say is that there is a contrib spellchecker already present in lucene....but just to be sure I mention it. Furthermore if you want to build it from scratch 1 might be an interesting read explaining the basics of how a lucene spellchecker might be developed. It though might be too simple but instructive if you are just starting with the concepts - 1 http today.java.net lpt a 211Committed an initial version in jackrabbit-core which allows to configure a custom spell checker implementation. I ll soon commit an implementation based on the lucene-spellcheck contrib to the jackrabbit sandbox. svn revision 587866Committed spellchecker implementation to sandbox jackrabbit-spellchecker. svn revision 587868Added a wiki page which describes the new feature http wiki.apache.org jackrabbit SpellChecker
