Bundle binding deserialization problem
I m trying to upgrade from 1.3.x to jackrabbit 1.4.x branch and have problems with existing repostories probaly the same issue is with 1.5.x Caused by org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.ItemStateException failed to read bundle deadbeef-face-babe-cafe-babecafebabe java.lang.IllegalArgumentException invalid namespaceURI specified Êat org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.bundle.BundleDbPersistenceManager.loadBundle BundleDbPersistenceManager.java 1229 Êat org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.bundle.BundleDbPersistenceManager.loadBundle BundleDbPersistenceManager.java 1161 It looks that issue was introduced by resolving JCR-1632After reading and ignoring some property names jcr mixinTypes jcr uuid jcr primaryType also folllowing property entries should be read and ignored to do not break deserialization. Patch proposal eattached 1 for the patch go ahead and commit it thanks stefanFixed in rev. 698935Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 698938.Good stuff thanks for spotting this before 1.4.6 went out
