Add log information when node property type determination fails
getQNodeDefinition and getQPropertyDefinition of o.a.j.jcr2spi.nodetype.ItemDefinitionProviderImpl silently ignore errors which might occur on determination of node and property types. Instead these methods use RepositoryService.getNodeDefinition and RepositoryService.getPropertyDefinition respectively to determine the types. This might lead to difficult to track down problems when the RepositoryService call occurs because of an error in the node type definition. I suggest to add logging statements to these methods.Proposed patch. The patch logs the exception which causes the RepositoryService methods to be called at debug level. Any exception from the RepositoryService methods is logged at error level and re-thrown.Fixed at revision 760479 applied the patchReopening for 1.5.0Fixed at revision 766769
