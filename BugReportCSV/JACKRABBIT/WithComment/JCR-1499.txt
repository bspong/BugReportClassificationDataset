Error logged when repository is shut down
This only happens with the bundle DerbyPersistenceManager. In DerbyPersistenceManager.close the embedded derby database is shut down and then super.close is called. There the ConnectionRecoveryManager is closed which tries to operate on a connection to the already shut down derby database. The log contains entries like 25.03.2008 13 49 29 ERROR Thread-5 ConnectionRecoveryManager failed to close connection reason No current connection. state code 08003 40000 ConnectionRecoveryManager.java line 453 Moved super.close above derby shutdown in DerbyPersistenceManager. Fixed in revision 640792This issue was introduced with enhancement described in JCR-940.Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 650342.
