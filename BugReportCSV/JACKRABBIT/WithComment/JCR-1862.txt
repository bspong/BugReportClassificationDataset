jcr2spi transient removal of mandatory item throws ConstraintViolationException
reported by tobi the transient removal of a mandatory non-protected item immediately fails. instead the check should be postponed until the save call since it would be perfectly legal to remove the mandatory item and then re-add it. suggested fix ItemStateValidator checkRemoveConstraints should only check for protection and ignore mandatory definitions.Can this be resolved as fixed BTW thanks for merging this to 1.5 ah sure... regarding merge no problem... merging at the point of fixing an issue is really not an big deal.
