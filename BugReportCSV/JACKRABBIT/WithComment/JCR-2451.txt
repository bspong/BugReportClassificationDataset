Implement RepositoryFactory in jcr2dav
It s currently a bit cumbersome to set up a spi2dav instance because of the two levels of factories RepositoryFactory RepositoryServiceFactory involved in the process. It would be easier if spi2dav implemented RepositoryFactory directly so downstream users would only need to provide the server URI parameter instead of specifying also the RepositoryServiceFactory classname. To do this spi2dav would need to depend also on jcr2spi. This change would actually simplify downstream projects that then wouldn t need to depend also to jcr2spi to get JCR - DAV connectivity.Proposed patch.I discussed this with Angela and Michael at work and we thought it best to keep the current scope of the spi2dav component and introduce a separate jcr2dav component that contains the proposed RepositoryFactory class. See the updated patch for the proposed new component. 1 for the updated patch jcr2dav module for 2.0 However I think we should discuss riview the overall module structure in general for future releases.I agree that the overall module structure should be revised as soon as possible. Creating a new project that contains one class is strange.Adjusted subject s spi2dav jcr2dav Agreed about the dislike for such a small component. It however seems like the easiest way forward especially since I d like to have this included already in 2.0 and I d prefer to avoid making too big changes to our component structure at this point.The jackrabbit-jcr2dav component now exists in trunk and the 2.0 branch. Resolving as Fixed.
