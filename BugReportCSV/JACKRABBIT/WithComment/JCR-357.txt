Move to jackrabbit.apache.org
Jackrabbit will be moving to    http jackrabbit.apache.org There are a number of infrastructure tasks that will need to be done by Roy. There will also be a need to change our documentation and site to point to the new URL and mailing list addresses which can be done by anyone. The existing mailing lists will be moved     jackrabbit-dev at incubator dev at jackrabbit.apache.org     jackrabbit-commits at incubator commits at jackrabbit.apache.org and I will add    users at jackrabbit.apache.org Completed move of the mailing lists Completed move of the website to    http jackrabbit.apache.org but we still have incubator stuff left to remove. I updated the web site to change most of the references to mailing lists and subversion paths inside the incubator. Does the user mailing list archive will appear at mail-archive.apache.org once there is traffic on that list or do we need to explicitly request the archive Are gmane mail-archive archives already being set up I can do that if needed.The Apache mail-archives will either fix itself at some point during the day crontab or I ll have to reinstall it from scratch to fix the current nonsensical mod mbox install. Lists are added to mail-archive.org automatically. Gmane is not so they may need to be notified of the list move. Please do so if you know how. Gmane is not so they may need to be notified of the list move. Please do so if you know how. Done. It may take a few days before my request is processed.Done.
