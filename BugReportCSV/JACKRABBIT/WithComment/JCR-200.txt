move log4j initialization out of RepositoryStartupServlet
the RepositoryStartupServlet initializes configures the Log4J environment. this might not be desirable since other applications might already done so. removed log4j configuration code from the RepositoryAccessSerlvet and created a LoggingServlet that also can be configured using log4j s DOMConfigurator. - removed WEB-INF repository log4j.properties - added WEB-INF log4j.xml fixed in r240176
