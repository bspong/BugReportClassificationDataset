Add files generated by eclipse or maven to svn ignore
To make life easier for eclipse and maven users please add the following files to svn ingore jackrabbit-jcr-rmi .settings .classpath .project jackrabbit-jcr-rmi-pom-snapshot-version project.xml.md5 jackrabbit-core .settings .classpath .project jackrabbit-core-pom-snapshot-version project.xml.md5 Maybe there some files missing in this list that could help developers using IDEA Updated the svn ignore properties in revisions 440525 and 440527. In general I think it s better to use local Subversion ignore rules to exclude such files but I don t suppose it harms anyone to have the ignores also in the repository. Note that the applied changes only affect jacrabbit core and jcr-rmi.
