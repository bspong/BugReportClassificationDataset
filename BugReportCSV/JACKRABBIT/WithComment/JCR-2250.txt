Base64 bug - last buffer not flushed
I found an issue when using the org.apache.jackrabbit.util.Base64.encode InputStream in OutputStream out method. It appears that the issue is that the last buffer is not flushed on the Writer that it creates before returning from the method. I was able to work around this issue by creating a Writer my own program and call another encode method and then call the flush method before using the data. The source in trunk appears the same. fixed in svn r802754 thanks Merged to the 1.6 branch in revision 899734.
