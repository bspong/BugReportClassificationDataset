JSR 283 Identifier based event filtering
JSR 283 PFD states Only events whose associated parent node has one of the identifiers in the uuid String array will be received. If this parameter is null then no identifier-related restriction is placed on events received. Note that specifying an empty array instead of null results in no nodes being listened to. The uuid is used for backwards compatibility with JCR 1.0. Interestingly enough this is already working... Jackrabbit does not check if the node to be filtered is actually mix referenceable it just compares the given UUIDs. Which is what the new behaviour is in JSR 283. Added test case in revision 765337
