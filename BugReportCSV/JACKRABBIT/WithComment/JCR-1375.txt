Limit fields read from index
Reading a lucene document from the index should be limited to only those fields that are necessary.Fixed in revision 620866When there are stored fields with significant content i.e. to support highlighting resolving the hierarchy in a query is very expensive without this change. Merged changes into the 1.4 branch for jackrabbit-core 1.4.2 release. svn revision 635855How pressing is the need to release this in 1.4.2 AFAIUI this is a performance improvement and as such I d rather target this for 1.5.I d describe it as a performance fix If you enable support for highlighting in the query handler and upload documents where text is extracted the query performance will drop significantly for hierarchy resolution. I ve seen queries taking 10 or more seconds on a workspace with a reasonable amount of content. With this fix the time drops to milliseconds.
