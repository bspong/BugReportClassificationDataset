Access cluster node id
I need to know the cluster node id in my application. I didn t find any other way than to cast to org.apache.jackrabbit.core.RepositoryImpl RepositoryImpl session.getRepository .getConfig .getClusterConfig .getId I would appreciate it if I could get to this using the system property ClusterNode.SYSTEM PROPERTY NODE ID.The only problem I can think of is when running two JR instances in one JVM. If that is a concern we could add a method in the JR api to fetch the id. Is this a real concern or can I go ahead and apply the patch two JR instances in one JVM I can see one problem where you start 2 nodes one after the other the first one generates an id and sets the system property then the second one will use the already set property as the id. This will break the scenario where you start 2 nodes just to run a simple test on you local machine and it can probably affect unit testing integration testing as well. If this is only about convenience probably adding a method to JctUtils would be the easiest.In CRX we expose the cluster node id through an extra crx.cluster.id repository descriptor. I think Jackrabbit could well do something similar.I like the descriptor idea. I ll try to find some time to create a patch Any objections to committing this also to the 2.4 and 2.2 branches The descriptor not the system property No objections here. We normally avoid backporting any non-bugfix changes to maintenance branches to reduce the chance of unexpected breakage and to avoid compatibility issues between two patch releases from the same branch but the potential impact of a change like this is so minimal that if you find this feature useful then I m fine with backporting it to 2.4 and 2.2.That is exactly the reason why I asked - Thx. Backported to 2.4 and 2.2.
