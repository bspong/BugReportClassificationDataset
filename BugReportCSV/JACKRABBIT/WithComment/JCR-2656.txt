Embedded Derby fails under JBoss because of JMX-related conflicts
JBoss fails to start due to a bug in Derby-10.4.2.0. The dependency should be agains derby-10.4.2.1 which seems to has this bug fixed. More info at https issues.apache.org jira browse DERBY-3887 Please include this fix in the upcoming 1.6.3Derby 10.4.2.1 is not yet released and I d rather not do a more major dependency upgrade in a Jackrabbit patch release so removing this from the 1.6.3 release plan.So how can use Jackrabbit 1.6.2 under JBoss Since this dependency upgrade shouldn t cause any unexpected problems for downstream projects I decided to upgrade the Derby version to 10.5.3.0 1 for Jackrabbit 1.6.4. Done in revision 998299.
