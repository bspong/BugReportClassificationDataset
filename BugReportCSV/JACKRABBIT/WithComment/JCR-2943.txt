UserManagement membership cache default size too small
The membership cache that has been introduced in JCR-2703 is making use of an LRUMap to cache group memberships authorizable nodeId - group nodeIds . In environments where users belong to more than 100 groups the cache quickly becomes ineffective due to the default maximum size of the LRUMap. Once the cache limit is hit the rather expensive Node getWeakReferences API calls resulting in search queries are executed again leading to quite noticeable performance drops. Thus I d suggest to either make the membership cache configurable or introduce some logic to let the cache grow dynamically as needed still having some kind of hard limit to avoid memory issues .For transparency reasons it d be good to have some debug logging in place which allows one to monitor the cache s efficiency e.g. cache hit or miss. If it is not too expensive to get the actual id of the authorizable in question it d be great to output this as part of the debug message as well.use the growing lru map functionality used by michael in the ac evaluation. however i didn t add additional debug information since the node identifier didn t seem to be useful from my point of view.
