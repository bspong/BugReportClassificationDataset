Read permission on parent node required to access an item s definition
If a session is granted all permissions on a given item B but lacks permission to read it s parent node A an attempt to access the definition of B by means of Node.getDefinition or Property.getDefinition will fail with AccessDeniedException. Similarly the same session will not be able to modify that item B - e.g. add a child node in case it was a node - since implementation e.g. checks of that item B isn t protected which is determined by looking at the definition. My feeling is that the item definition should be accessible even if the parent node cannot be read.patch modifying ItemManager getDefinitiion NodeState and getDefinition PropertyState replacing getItem NodeId parentId by calls that omit the permission check. and 2 tests cases a node and it s definition is accessible even if the parent cannot be read b child nodes can be added to node B even B s parent A cannot be read 1 for the patch thanks stefanapplied patch with minor modification referring to this issue in the comments added to ItemManager
