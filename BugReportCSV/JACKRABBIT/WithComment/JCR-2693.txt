Logging per test case
Thanks to the switch to Logback a while ago JCR-2584 we can start taking advantage of some nice new features like the one described in 1 . With this trick we ll be able to split the currently pretty large jcr.log test log file we have to separate log files per each test case. This will make it much easier to review the logs written during any particular test. 1 http www.nalinmakar.com 2010 07 28 logging-tests-to-separate-files The attached patch implements this feature for jackrabbit-core.Patch committed in revision 984713.
