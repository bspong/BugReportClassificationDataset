tck doesn t compile use of enum keyword 
Use if enum keyword in TestFinder patch will be attached Have fun..Another patch. The war is missing the jcr jar in the war. Added a property to the project.xmlBesides that the tests all fail out of the box but that was noted already as far as I can see.Thanks for the patches Martin. However I ve only committed the TestFinder changes. The jcr.jar has intentionally been omitted because it is assumed that the TCK war is deployed in an environment that already contains the jcr.jar. If we would add it to the war file the classses would be visible twice which results in ClassCastExceptions in most application servers or servlet engines. Regarding the failing test cases did you configure the TCK webapp to tell it which repository to test Fixed in revision 280299
