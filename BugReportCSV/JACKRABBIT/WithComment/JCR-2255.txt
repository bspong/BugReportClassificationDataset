activity storage path
JSR-283 states in 15.12.3 15.12.3 Activity Storage Activities are persisted as nodes of type nt activity under system-generated node names in activity storage below jcr system jcr activities. As far as I can tell this is currently not the case. A related test case org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.version.ActivitiesTest testActivitiesPath apparently was taken out accidentally. If Jackrabbit can t implement this JCR requirement we either need to document it or raise it as issue in the JCR Expert Group.the only workspace that is shared among all others is the version workspace and it is virtually mounted at jcr system jcr versionStorage. creating a new persistent workspace for just the activities is a bit overkill also in the light of the upcoming restructure of the jcr system shared space. the problem is that a virtual item state provide can only have 1 root so the activities were put below jcr system jcr versionStorage jcr activities. to change this we could 1 try to allow multiple roots for virtual providers 2 introduce a activities workspace and create a virtual provider just for this 3 try to create a shared node at jcr system jcr activities i favor to relax the spec in this respect but will try if i can implement 1 found a way to expose the jcr activities at the correct location.
