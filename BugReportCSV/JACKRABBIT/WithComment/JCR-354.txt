Use a pre-generated version of XPath.jjt
The workaround described in JCR-46 is still causing extra steps for Java 5 users. I d like to solve this issue by including a pre-generated version of the XPath.jjt file as a normal source file. This will avoid the need for XSL transformations during normal builds and thus remove the need for the extra steps. I ll create a patch for this and unless anyone objects I m planning to include it in the 1.0 branch as well as the svn trunk.Attached a patch containing the pre-generated XPath.jjt file. The source XML and XSL files are very static so this should not cause any noticeable development trouble. In addition to containing the XPath.jjt file this patch changes the related maven.xml scripting and removes the Java 5 notices from README.txt and the Building Jackrabbit documentation page.Makes sense. I think this is a very good approach to avoid the build troubles. 1Patch committed in revision 386412. Merged to the 1.0 branch in revision 386413.
