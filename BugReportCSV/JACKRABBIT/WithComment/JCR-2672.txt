Cache also failed principal lookups
The principal cache in Jackrabbit normally does a good job in ensuring good performance in critical areas like ACL evaulation. However the cache only includes successful principal lookups so an ACE that references a missing or mistyped principal can cause notable performance issues as a new principal lookup is needed whenever the node covered by such an ACL is accessed. To solve that problem I propose that we extend the principal cache to also cover negative principal lookups.The attached patch implements the proposed change. To solve that problem I propose that we extend the principal cache to also cover negative principal lookups. fine by me. angelaRevision 964362 Applied a modified version of the patch provided by jukka - no enabled in AbstractPrincipalProvider by default - added config option - DefaultPrincipalProvider enables negative-cache unless it is explicitly turn off on by the config. - in addition to the patch the negative-entry cached required some adjustment to the cache-clearing mechanism in   the DefaultPrincipalProvider. - finally also added a couple of tests.
