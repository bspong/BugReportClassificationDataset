Incorrect results from joins on multivalued properties
It looks like join conditions on multivalued properties only use one of the multiple values for the comparison.For the record the attached patch was my first attempt at fixing this. It solves the problem by using the ItemStateManager instead of the search index to access property values but that approach comes at a horrible performance cost. Tomorrow I ll try to come up with an alternative fix that uses the search index to access all instead of just one of the property values.Fixed this in revisions 986686 and 986715. Note that the solution also fixes or works around some incorrect outer join semantics as discussed in JCR-2719.The attached performance plot shows that the solution I implemented makes join queries slightly slower. I think in this case the performance impact is small enough.Merged to the 2.1 branch in revision 986736.
