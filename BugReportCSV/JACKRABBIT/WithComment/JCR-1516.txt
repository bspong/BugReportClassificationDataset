Add Compact Namespace and Node Type Definition support to spi-commons
Add support for reading and writing of Compact Namespace and Node Type Definitions cnd-files to spi-commons.The patch adds support for reading and writing cnd-files to spi-commons. A test case is also included.looks good to me. one thing if we have a ValueConstraint in the spi-commons i would like to use this one in jcr2spi and get rid of the constraint in jcr2spi remove . if nobody objects i would do that.extended patch that removes ValueConstraint in jcr2spi fixes problems in the spi-commons ValueConstraint and includes some trivial tests for the various types of value constraint. any objections for removing o.a.j.jcr2spi.nodetype.ValueConstraint michael thanks for the patch. angela
