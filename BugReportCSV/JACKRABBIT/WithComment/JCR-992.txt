Improve Performance of DescendantSelfAxisQuery
In DescendantSelfAxisQuery.DescendantSelfAxisScorer.isValid int contextHits is populated with docs that are found on the way down the axis. The current algorithm unfortunately doesn t add any new docs at all because it only adds docs already present in contextHits. This leads to more calls to HierarchyResolver.getParent int than necessary.This patch adds logic to add all docs on the way down the axis to contextHits if the given doc is a child of the context.Thanks a lot for the patch. Looks good. I only renamed the list from parentDocs to ancestorDocs before I committed the patch. svn revision 551890
