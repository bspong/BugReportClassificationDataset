XML import always throws ItemExistsException when trying to overwrite existing nodes
According to the JCR-API it should be possible to govern the import of XML serialized referenceable nodes in case of UUID collision. Unfortunately the UUID conflict is handled too late during import an ItemExistsException is always thrown beforehand due to not allowed same-name-siblings. Simply try to import a previously exported referenceable node twice providing either - ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT UUID COLLISION REMOVE EXISTING or - ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT UUID COLLISION REPLACE EXISTING. This will fail and result in an ItemExistsException.fixed in svn r575325 thanks for reporting this issue Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 577696.
