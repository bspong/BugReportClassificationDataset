Broke lock tests in jcr2spi after the JCR 2.0 upgrade
My changes during the JCR 2.0 upgrade have broken the following tests in spi2jcr     org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.lock.LockTest     org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.lock.SessionScopedLockTest I ll mark them as known issues for now to get the Hudson build back up again but will continue looking at what I did to cause this breakage.adjusted subject its not SPI tests that are failing but tests against the JCR API.isn t this a duplicate of JCR-2004 Update SPI locking to match JCR 2.0 from my point of view it doesn t make too much sense to create bugs for all the failing tests as long as jcr2spi the spi and its implementation are not adjusted to work with JCR 2.0the tests listed in this issue no longer fail.
