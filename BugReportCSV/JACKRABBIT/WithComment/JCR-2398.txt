AdministratorTest.testAdminNodeCollidingWithRandomNode failure
I see the following test failure with the latest trunk. It seems to affect also Sébastien as commented in JCR-2389. However it doesn t break the Hudson build or Angela s checkout. I m filing this as a bug and will disable the test for now to be able to cut the 2.0-beta3 release. We can look at this later in more detail. The detailed failure message is Test set org.apache.jackrabbit.core.security.user.TestAll Tests run 144 Failures 1 Errors 0 Skipped 0 Time elapsed 4.078 sec FAILURE testAdminNodeCollidingWithRandomNode org.apache.jackrabbit.core.security.user.AdministratorTest Time elapsed 0.072 sec FAILURE junit.framework.AssertionFailedError         at junit.framework.Assert.fail Assert.java 47         at junit.framework.Assert.assertTrue Assert.java 20         at junit.framework.Assert.assertFalse Assert.java 34         at junit.framework.Assert.assertFalse Assert.java 41         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.security.user.AdministratorTest.testAdminNodeCollidingWithRandomNode AdministratorTest.java 205 I marked the test as a known issue in revision 882098.i will take a look at iti managed to reproduce the failure when running all test of the security.user package in my ide. changes made with rev. 884184 fixed the problem for me with all kind of jr configurations setups etc...... please reopen if it still fails in other environments.
