Issues with compiled permissions of ACL provider

It would probably be a good idea to generate a coherent ACL cache for all principals. in the initial patch there was such a cache written by you if i remember correctly . As i rewrote most of the ac provider code i didn t want to have legacy caches just because we used to have them and decided to remove them with the possibility to reintroduce caches where needed.rev 828791 remove searching for DENY-read entries in case of default initialization of ac entries that allows read for everyone see also JCR-2331 resolving this issue fixed. additional improvements should go into separate issues.
