Move tika-parsers dependency to deployment packages
As discussed on the mailing list it would be better if the tika-parsers dependency and all the parser libraries it pulls in transitively was included in our deployment packages but not directly in jackrabbit-core. This would make it easier for people to set up custom lightweight deployments with no or only partial full text extraction functionality. To do this we ll first need to wait for Tika 0.9 as we currently have a custom PDFParser class in jackrabbit-core as a workaround to a problem in Tika 0.8. At the same time we should do a more thorough review of the transitive parser dependencies we include. At least the rome and bouncycastle libraries were flagged as potentially unnecessary.I moved the dependency from jackrabbit-core in revision 1076635. At the same time I went through the list of dependencies and made the following exclusions          exclusions            Exclude the NetCDF and the related commons-httpclient            libraries since the related NetCDF and HDF file            formats are not widely used beyond scientific data.            exclusion              groupId edu.ucar groupId              artifactId netcdf artifactId            exclusion            exclusion              groupId commons-httpclient groupId              artifactId commons-httpclient artifactId            exclusion            Exclude the Apache MIME4J library as it s used for            parsing raw email messages and mbox files which are            typically only needed by a file-based email system.            exclusion              groupId org.apache.james groupId              artifactId apache-mime4j artifactId            exclusion            Exclude the Commons Compress library as we don t want            to parse compressed archives like zips by default.            exclusion              groupId org.apache.commons groupId              artifactId commons-compress artifactId            exclusion            Exclude the ASM library as it s only used for parsing            Java class files for which there s typically no need            in a content repository.            exclusion              groupId asm groupId              artifactId asm artifactId            exclusion            Exclude the extractor library for EXIF and other            image metadata as we normally don t want to parse            images for full text indexing.            exclusion              groupId com.drewnoakes groupId              artifactId metadata-extractor artifactId            exclusion            Exclude the Rome library as we normally don t want to            parse RSS and Atom feeds for full text indexing.            exclusion              groupId rome groupId              artifactId rome artifactId            exclusion            Exclude the Boilerpipe library as we don t use the            BoilerpipeContentHandler functionality from Tika.            exclusion              groupId de.l3s.boilerpipe groupId              artifactId boilerpipe artifactId            exclusion          exclusions After these exclusions we d still keep the following dependencies     PDF pdfbox fontbox jempbox bcmail bcprov     MS Office poi poi-ooxml poi-ooxml-schemas poi-scratchpad xmlbeans     HTML tagsoup Basic formats like plain text and XML plus rudimentary support for OpenOffice are handled with the standard Java class library.Resolving as fixed based on the above changes.
