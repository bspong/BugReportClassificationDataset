Add CopyMoveHanlder so that the copy move behavior can be customized as this is the case for the IOHandler and PropertyHandler 
The IOHandler impls let you define a specific import export behavior either for specific nodetypes locations etc which is just great. this works well while you create or modify a web dav resource but does not work for the copy move use case. the attached patch provides a proposal for an additional CopyMoveHandler.patch contains proposal for the copy move use casepatch contains proposal for the copy move use casethanks for patch. looks good. i will apply it with some minor modifications - passing the source destination davresources instead of source-locator and destination path - in analogy to the IOHandler and PropertyHandler i would create a copymovecontext that allows to retrieve   the workspace and or session object and provides additional details of the copy move operation.   such as e.g. if the copy should be shallow or not. hope that fits your needs.applied patch with the modifications mentioned above some minor renaming and additional javadoc.
