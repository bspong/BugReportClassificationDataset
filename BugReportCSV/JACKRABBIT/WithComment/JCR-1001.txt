SPI prefer Iterator instead of specialized subclasses
in the F2F we agreed that the SPI should rather use Iterator instead of specialized subclassed or RangeIterator .removed IdIterator EventIterator QNodeTypeDefinitionIterator QResultRowIterator interfaces and implementing classes. All corresponding return values were changed to Iterator except for QResultRowIterator which was changed to RangeIterator due to usage of the additional methods within the query code. rev. 553409slightly modified contrib jackrabbit-spi-xml in order not to break its compilation untested . rev. 553411
