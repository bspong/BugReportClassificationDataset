JcrRemotingServlet should interpolate system properties in the home init-param
For deployment scenarios where the same Jackrabbit WAR file is deployed multiple times on the same server with the same current working directory it is useful to have the home init-param support system property interpolation.here s a patchIs there really even a need for this configuration setting I d just use the standard java.io.tmpdir for temporary files and simply avoid the need for these configuration options. See the attached patch for the proposed change.if this setting can be simply removed that works for me.hi jukka i would prefer a patch that is backwards compatible but dealing with missing init-param. was that possible Sounds OK. I ll make another patch that uses java.io.tmpdir as the default but keeps to the current behavior when the any of the init-params is present. That should cover Justin s needs as well as retaining backwards compatibility for existing configurations.I modified the fix as proposed and committed the revised version in revision 1155403. Now java.io.tmpdir gets used as the default from DiskFileItemFactory when neither the home nor the temp-directory init parameters are present. If either is set then the temporary directory is constructed as before.
