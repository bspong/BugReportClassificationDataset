JCARepositoryManager.createNonTransientRepository throws NPE with no JCAManagedConnectionFactory.CONFIGFILE KEY
JCARepositoryManager.createNonTransientRepository fails if String configFile parameters.get JCAManagedConnectionFactory.CONFIGFILE KEY is null because config RepositoryConfig.create configFile homeDir will always throw an NPE perhaps the call should just be config RepositoryConfig.create homeDir Normally you must define both. This code was not changed for very long time but good hint i will change it to work with homeDir only as well. Committed in revision 1232831.Merged to the 2.4 branch revision 1233365.
