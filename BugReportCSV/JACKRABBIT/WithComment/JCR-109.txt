Contrib RMI NotSerializableException
org.apache.jackrabbit.rmi.client.RemoteRepositoryException error unmarshalling return nested exception is .java.io.WriteAbortedException writing aborted java.io.NotSerializableException javax.jcr.NameValue I found and fixed one occasion in JCR-RMI where Values passed over the network are not decorated with the SerialValue serialization decorator. The missing decoration was in ServerRow.getValue and the fix in revision 161928. I m assuming that this fix solves your problem. Please reopen the issue if the problem still appears.Reported by Rob Owen This problem occurs with ServerRow.getValues too. I have attached a patch which makes the corresponding change to getValues that was made to getValue String .

This is a serious and simple enough fix that I applied it also to the 0.9 branch in revision 374018.
