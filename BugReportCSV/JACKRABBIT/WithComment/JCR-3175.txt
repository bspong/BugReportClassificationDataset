InputContextImpl cannot upload file larger than 2GB
If an entity is larger than 2GB the Content-Length cannot be obtained by using getIntHeader because of integer overflow. One needs to parse the value of the header from string to long. This issue affects InputContextImpl.getContentLength in org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav.io from webdav java the current behavior is that the header is converted from string to int by the servlet API then from int to long by Jackrabbit Testcase largefile from Litmus. test 3 - large put fails when the PUT request is received Patch applied with additional exception handling thanks Javier Merged to the 2.2 branch in revision 1235791.
