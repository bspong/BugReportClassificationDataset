Drop the Dumpable interface
I belive the o.a.j.core.util.Dumpable interface was originally used for diagnostic purposes but AFAIUI we don t use it anywhere anymore. I d like to drop the interface and refactor the dump methods in various Jackrabbit classes to more detailed toString methods that would be more useful to debuggers and other general-purpose diagnostic tools.Done in revision 1004622 for jackrabbit-core. There s a similar interface also in jackrabbit-jcr2spi which I d also like to replace with standard toString methods.what about SessionImpl.dump it used to dump the internal session state e.g. transient items etc. it proofed to be quite useful while debugging at least for me. btw i fail to see any benefit in removing this interface. what was your motivation what about SessionImpl.dump I dropped it because SessionImpl already had a toString method and it seemed wrong to include too many internal details in the return value of a method that s directly accessible by JCR clients. We could instead print out the component details in SessionContext.toString . I ll take a look at that. i fail to see any benefit in removing this interface. what was your motivation The same functionality can be implemented in a more interoperable way using toString methods. As an added bonus we even get rid of one extra internal abstraction.In revision 1005019 I restored the essential functionality of SessionImpl.dump in the SessionContext.toString method. In revision 1005019 I restored the essential functionality of SessionImpl.dump in the SessionContext.toString method. thanks Done also for jcr2spi in revision 1032651.
