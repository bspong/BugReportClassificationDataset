Investigate ways to compile the refactored jcr-mapping for Java 1.4
The last refactoring of the jcr-mapping project included the annotation based mapping description into the main code based thus requiring compilation with Java 5 or higher. There are still some use cases which require Java 1.4. The goal is to investigate whether it would be possible to define a build profile in the pom which compiles for 1.4 by ignoring the annotation classes.Added a build profile jdk1.4 which compiles into Java 1.4 class files ommiting the new annotation classes. Please close if this suites your needs. ThankssI replaced the Java 1.4 profile with the retrotranslator-maven-plugin from codehaus see http mojo.codehaus.org retrotranslator-maven-plugin . It seems like a simpler solution.
