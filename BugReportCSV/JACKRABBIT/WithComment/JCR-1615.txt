WebDAV drop dependency on commons-collections
the webdav library brings in a dependency on commons-collections solely for one reference to LinkedMap. Since none of the additional features of this class are used and as I understand it Jackrabbit requires JDK 1.4 this can be replaced with LinkedHashMap. jcr-commons still brings in the commons-collections dependency but I believe it can be safely excluded by users that don t need to use the predicates Which is true of the webdav client it s not the dav-client code that introduces the dependency - adjust summary.fixed at rev 658169 i didn t create an extra tests but running some read-only tests jcr2spi-spi2dav-jcrserver didn t reveal problems related to the change. so i assume it s ok. thanks for the patch.
