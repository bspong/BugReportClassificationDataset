JCR-Server Workspace.restore not mapped correctly
 issue reported by David Kennedy Workspace.restore Version boolean won t work since versions are not retrieved correctly. The version history that can be access from the request resource cannot be used to retrieve the versions needed for a workspace.restore call. possible short term fix From the version-hrefs present in the request body of the UPDATE request version resources must be built and the corresponding version item retrieved. alternative find a proper mapping for Workspace.restore Version boolean . having UPDATE on a resource representing a javax.jcr.Node being mapped to a workspace.restore is odd. additional thoughts what is actually missing in the jcr-server is a distint resource representing the workspace . currently the root node also acts somehow as workspace. i will take a closer look at this point which may provide also a smarter solution for this bug.rev. 448257 - introduces a distinct resource for the workspace that does not represent the root-node at the same time - Workspace.restore is now handled by this resource. since this implied some additional changes e.g. defining a fake name for the resource representing the root node i will perform some more tests before resolving this issue.fixed note that this change modified the structure exposed by the jcr-server workspace resource and the resource representing the root node are now distinct dav resources.
