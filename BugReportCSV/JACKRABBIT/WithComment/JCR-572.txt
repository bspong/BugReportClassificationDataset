Referenced derby library behaves buggy on FreeBSD
The derby library referenced on dependencies page http jackrabbit.apache.org dependencies.html behaves buggy on FreeBSD. This is the same issue like the one with Magnolia CMS http jira.magnolia.info browse MAGNOLIA-818. Version derby-10.1.3.1 works fine. Upgraded the Apache Derby dependency in revisions 447152 447154 447157 and 447158.
