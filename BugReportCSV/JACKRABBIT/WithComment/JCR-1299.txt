Default configuration not suitable for demo web application
The default configuration is not suitable for the demo application. There are no text extractors configured which makes the populate and search demos useless. Proposed solution create a new repository.xml in jackrabbit-webapp with text extractors configured. I know we should actually try to reduce the number of repository.xml files but having one dedicated to jackrabbit-webapp seems reasonable while we should try to achieve the same for the jackrabbit-core module.How about configuring the text extractors already in the repository.xml in jackrabbit-core We already have a compile-scoped dependency to text-extractors in core so it s reasonable to expect that the classes are available in normal deployments.Hmm there are also other features that I would like to enable for the demo web application excerpts and spell checking. But you are right why shouldn t we enable those features per default I ll create a patch.Configuration patchCommitted patch in 1.4 branch 610382 and trunk 610383 .
