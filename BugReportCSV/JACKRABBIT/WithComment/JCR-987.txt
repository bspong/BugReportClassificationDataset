Deploy JCA JAR file to maven repository
Please deploy the JCA JAR file to the maven repository ibiblio whenever deploying the RAR artifact. The JAR is need for non managed usage of the Jackrabbit JCA eg. for embedding the resource adapter in your application with Spring JCA in order to use XA for Jackrabbit. It would be nice if this could be done starting at the current 1.3 version and for future versions too . Thanks Fixed in revision 604929. The jackrabbit-jca jar file will be available in the central Maven repository once the Jackrabbit 1.4 release is out.
