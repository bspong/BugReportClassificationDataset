XML export stream doesn t initialize TransformerHandler properly
For instance in SessionImpl.java     public void exportSystemView String absPath OutputStream out                                  boolean skipBinary boolean noRecurse             throws IOException PathNotFoundException RepositoryException         SAXTransformerFactory stf SAXTransformerFactory SAXTransformerFactory.newInstance         try             TransformerHandler th stf.newTransformerHandler             th.setResult new StreamResult out             th.getTransformer .setParameter OutputKeys.METHOD xml             th.getTransformer .setParameter OutputKeys.ENCODING UTF-8             th.getTransformer .setParameter OutputKeys.INDENT no             exportSystemView absPath th skipBinary noRecurse          catch TransformerException te             throw new RepositoryException te          catch SAXException se             throw new RepositoryException se               1 It should be setOutputProperty not setParameter 2 My tests show that setting the parameters only has an effect when done before calling setResult That being said the effect is minor as the default settings for the TransformerHandler seem to be correct anway. Fixed in several places with revision 533508. I didn t want to touch contrib backup src main java org apache jackrabbit backup WorkspaceBackup.java any takers for that Same fix should probably applied to contrib backup src main java org apache jackrabbit backup WorkspaceBackup.java.Thanks for the fixes I m aplied the same change also to contrib backup in revision 540525. Resolved as Fixed.For the record this issue was introduced by JCR-367 in Jackrabbit release 1.1.Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 544284.
