WebApp Ease first access for new users looking for a WebDAV server
suggestion posted by mike oliver in the user list I know that JackRabbit isn t the same as Jakarta Slide and not expecting it to be but one thing we did right on that project was create a runnable war file that doesn t require any learning curve to get started. Install the war file create the network place and login as the root root user and start creating content folders and documents. If JackRabbit did that then I think more people would try it and use it and then spend the time to learn how to make it all it can be.Added some more instructions and streamlined the installation in revision 611136. Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 611140.I agree As a new user that needs a few pointers to getting Jackrabbit running. I have deployed the war using the tomcat manager file after installing Tomcat but have no idea where to put the jar files where the class path is etc. would anyone help please error The javax.jcr.Repository interface from the JCR API could not be loaded. To resolve this issue you need to make the jcr-1.0.jar available in the shared classpath of the servlet container. What would really help is a little bit more information in the First Hops section for people who are not already familiar with Java.
