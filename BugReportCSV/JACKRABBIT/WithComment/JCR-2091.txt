Searchability settings in PropertyDefinition
Related to JCR-1591 the new JCR 2.0 property definitions contain settings for searchability of properties. I m not sure how deeply we want to implement these settings perhaps we should just hard-code the values but in any case the relevant methods need to be implemented.the searchable settings are now handled on node type level. currently the settings have no effect on what s indexed what s searchable. i am not sure whether how we want to implement the semantics of the searchable node type attributes. wdyt marcel I think for the 2.0 release we should just leave things as they are. Later we can still use those settings instead of the current indexing configuration.i agree with marcel therefore resolving as fixed
