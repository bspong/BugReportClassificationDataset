NodeAddMixinTest assumptions on addMixin behaviour
NodeAddMixinTest.testAddMixinReferencable assumes that mix referenceable can be added to the test node type. In practice the node type may already inherit mix referenceable but it may not be active until the node is saved. Thus a ConstraintViolationException upon addMixin should be catched and the mixin should be checked after save again. Fixed with revision 530810. Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 544222.
