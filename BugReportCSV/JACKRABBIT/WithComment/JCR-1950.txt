Testing for indexable properties should check the default indexable properties first
org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.NodeIndexer addValue uses the following condition for a PropertyType.NAME type of property if isIndexed name                      name.equals NameConstants.JCR PRIMARYTYPE                      name.equals NameConstants.JCR MIXINTYPES                 addNameValue doc fieldName value.getQName It d be more efficient to test the default properties first which are on every node anyway than to query the custom indexing rules every time.Good point Changed as proposed in revision 736680Any chance of including this in 1.5.3 We normally avoid putting anything other than bug fixes in patch releases so this won t be in 1.5.3 unless there is some major reason why this should be included.
