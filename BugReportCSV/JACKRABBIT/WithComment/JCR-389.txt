WebDAV server should treat non-wellformed XML in request bodies as error
The WebDAV server should treat non-wellformed XML request bodies as errors instead of treating the request as if the request body was missing . causes Litmus test suite failure in test case propfind invalid This patch adds DavException to the signature of getRequestDocument and attempts to make sure that an exception is thrown when a request body is present but not well-formed wrapping the InputStream with a BufferedInputStream and peeking at the first byte was the most reliable way I could think of to find out whether there actually was a request body . commited patch rev. 392905 . In addition removed todo mark stating that invalid xml with propfind should result in 404 instead of treating as request for all-props. Note regarding the interface DavServletRequest.java Method signature with getRequestDocument has changed and now allows to throws DavException. I think this modification is a justifiable and b should not cause major compatibility issues. The AbstractWebdavServlet as well as all calling methods in the DavServletRequest and extensions have already been changed to throw DavException before the 1.0 release.
