TCK Test that expect that modifications made by Session1 are automatically visible to Session2
While changes made by session1 are automatically visible to any other session2 with the RI this is not required by the specification. Therefore i would suggest to modify the following test cases - NodeUUIDTest.testSaveMovedRefNode - SessionUUIDTest.testSaveMovedRefNode - no patch. sorry. - NodeTest.testRemoveInvalidItemStateException - see patch.the same applies for - NodeCanAddMixinTest.testLockedAdded the missing Node.refresh call in NodeCanAddMixinTest.testLocked. Fixed in revision 553515No more changes needed. Setting to fixed.Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 577703.
