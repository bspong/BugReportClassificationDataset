SetValueBinaryTest some repositories have constraints on where binary properties can be set
For repositories that do only support binary properties in the form of jcr content jcr data the current configurability is not sufficient. To avoid more config params I d suggest to check for propertyName1 jcr data node.hasNode jcr content and in that case to automatically navigate down to the jcr content child node. Proposed patch.Added with revision 524776. Reopening to change metadataAlso affects SetPropertyInputStreamTest.java. Fixed for SetPropertyInputStreamTest.java in revision 527970.
