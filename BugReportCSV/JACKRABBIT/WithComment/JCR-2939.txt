QueryObjectModel does not generate the corresponding SQL2 Query when dealing with spaces in the path
This is the original issue I tried to get the childnodes of a node names a b using the following code   QueryManager queryManager session.getWorkspace .getQueryManager   QueryObjectModelFactory qomf queryManager.getQOMFactory   Source source1 qomf.selector NodeType.NT BASE selector 0   Column columns new Column qomf.column selector 0 null null   Constraint constraint2 qomf.childNode selector 0 a b   QueryObjectModel qom qomf.createQuery source1 constraint2 null columns This is not giving any result when the session is acquired through webdav. But when connected using JNDI it is giving the child nodes. The sql statement getting created is SELECT selector 0. FROM nt base AS selector 0 WHERE ISCHILDNODE selector 0 a b . When using webdav If i give this SQL2 query directly along with quotes around the path i.e. a b then it is working as expected. this doesn t have anything to do with webdav. the problem is the QueryObjectModel generates an SQL2 query that is not 100 equivalent it fails to escape paths that have spaces in them. this way in the case of davex remoting the jr client will use the statement generated instead which is not escaped and will fail to return the expected nodes. This can be seen easily if we do a System.out.println qom.getStatement attached patch to fix and some testsFixed in trunk in rev 1126550 and 1126551Merged to 2.2 in rev 1126557.
