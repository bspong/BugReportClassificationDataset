JCR2SPI incomplete changelog when combining move with removal of new destination parent
fixed as follows - changed transient state manager to record all transient modifications without   making any attempt to optimize the list of operations. - Upon Item.save and Item.refresh false the changelog or a subset is created   containing all relevant operations. - Upon ChangeLog.persisted all operations are notified about completion and delegate   the call to the affected hierarchy entry. - Upon ChangeLog.undo the operations are reverted again informing the affected   hierarchy entry.
