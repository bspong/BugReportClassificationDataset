WebDAV LocatorFactoryImpl Locator.getHref constructs root resource URLs incorrectly
cadaver was reporting an error when i tried to open in my repository s default workspace at https localhost 8443 webdav . in tracking down the problem i saw something strange - the multistatus response s href had an extra tacked onto the end    D multistatus xmlns D DAV      D response        D href https localhost 8443 webdav lt D href WebdavServlet rather my subclass of it is mapped as the default servlet of a webapp mounted at webdav. i ve configured the WebdavServlet with a resource path prefix of incidentally i m not sure what that s meant to be used for - i see that when the value is not empty it s appended to the response s href but i don t know in what circumstance that would be useful . when i requested a child node such as https localhost 8443 webdav bcm gt the response s href was formed as expected    D multistatus xmlns D DAV      D response        D href https localhost 8443 webdav bcm lt D href i found that LocatorFactoryImpl Locator.getHref was adding the extra since the requested resource was a collection. i patched the method to not add the character when itemPath and cadaver stopped complaining. all is well. i also patched WebdavServlet to default to an empty resource path prefix if one is not specified as a servlet init parameter. enclosed patch referenced in issue description.thanks for reporting. i will look at it. tobi could you accept that bug so its marked as being worked on merci.Angela volunteeredfixed with minor modification as suggested. i added a comment that in general the handling of the root item needs some improvement... i will think about that more carefully. tobi min-fadlika ya sadiiqii.... would you do me a favour and commit the changes day-rev 13805 anchela rev 159607
