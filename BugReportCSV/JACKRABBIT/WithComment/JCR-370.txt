SearchIndex class contains garbled String
Somehow during the switch to SL4J also a String literal in the SearchIndex class got garbled. See http svn.apache.org viewcvs.cgi incubator jackrabbit trunk jackrabbit src main java org apache jackrabbit core query lucene SearchIndex.java rev 385280 r1 378221 r2 385280 Since this is a low risk change I would like to get this included into the 1.0 branch.Fixed in trunk svn revision 388117Jukka could you please commit this fix also in the 1.0 branch and close this issue If you think this should not be included in 1.0 please set the fixed version to 1.0.1 and close this issue. Thanks.This is a weird glitch. I suppose the only reasonable explanation for this would be me accidentally pasting random garbage after opening the file for manual inspection after running the SLF4J conversion script. Sorry about that. - Merged to 1.0 in revision 389545.
