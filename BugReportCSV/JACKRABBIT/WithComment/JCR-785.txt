Updates to multiple workspaces e.g. in a transaction locked in cluster journal
Running a transaction that updates multiple workspaces e.g. a versioning operation will be locked as they all try to acquire a non-reentrant lock in the cluster s journal. Short-term fix is to make the lock re-entrant. In the long run a transaction context sensitive lock may be more appropriate. How to reproduce enable clustering in the test environment and let the test o.a.j.core.XATest.testSetVersionLabel run. This will result in a deadlock when committing the operation. This was initially reported by Rafa Kwiecie as a problem when using springmodules and clustering but turned out to be general problem with transactions and clustering. Thanks for reporting it Made the read-write lock in o.a.j.core.journal.AbstractJournal re-entrant allowing the same commiting thread to reacquire the write-lock. All transaction-related tests in XATest now pass successfully. Fixed in revision 517141.
