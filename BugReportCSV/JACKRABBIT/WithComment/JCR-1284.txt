Use bundle persistence in default configuration
The default repository configuration files in jackrabbit-core and -webapp still use the old simple database persistence. They should be updated to use bundle persistence in the 1.4 release.Updated all the various repository configurations I could find in revision 608081. We should probably try to reduce the amount of different repository.xml files we have...Hi Jukka. I asked in the lists some time ago why we have so many repository.xml files and which one is for what. I think now is a good time to ask again Regards. I asked in the lists some time ago why we have so many repository.xml files and which one is for what. I think now is a good time to ask again I think nobody really knows... Optimally we d have just a single default repository.xml embedded in jackrabbit-core. All the other components and test suites would use that as the default configuration.Is this going to be fixed anytime soon Perhaps for 1.4 For now where s the main repository.xml file It s the one in core src main config
