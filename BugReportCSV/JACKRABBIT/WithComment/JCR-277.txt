reorganize xdocs and website
i would like to propose a change to the website and xdocs structure. the current structure below seems like it could use a brush up. Overview Architecture Doc .Overview ..JSR-170 Levels .Deployment Models ..Application HOWTO ..Model 1 HOWTO ..Model 2 HOWTO ..Model 3 HOWTO .Core Operations ..Start-up Initialize ..QueryManager Implementation First Steps JCR API Documentation Layout Downloads FAQ i would propose the following instead About Documentation .First Steps .JCR .API Documentation .Jackrabbit Architecture ..Start-up Initialize ..QueryManager Implementation .Deployment Models ..Application HOWTO ..Model 1 HOWTO ..Model 2 HOWTO ..Model 3 HOWTO .Nodetype Modelling new Layout Downloads FAQ also i would like to introduce a new homepage with a little bit more attractive content like jackrabbit news maybe featured jackrabbit applications schedules and events. ideally i would like to re-organize the file structure according to the navigation which may break bookmarks and search indexes. thoughts Go go go The current structure needs a lot of work. There is no need to wait for consensus on documentation just go ahead and commit what you think is right and everyone else can add to it or revert what they don t like. That layout looks good but I would remove the HOWTOs since they are under Documentation. I think the first page should be Download and Install before First Steps . Also I suggest using a meaningful name instead of numbering the models. But go ahead and do whatever you like first it is far easier for me to move stuff around after you have written it. - next rev of the structure completed
