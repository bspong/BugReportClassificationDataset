Extract JDBC Connection Init
An intermediate step to allowing a PM to be easily configurable through JNDI would be to extract the connection init. This will allow system integrators to subclass wrap and dynamically configure a customized Simple PM. In org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.db.SimpleDbPersistenceManager Replace lines 296-298 with         initConnection Add Initialize the JDBC connection protected void initConnection throws Exception             Class.forName driver             con DriverManager.getConnection url user password             con.setAutoCommit false This is pretty much what I had in mind for JCR-313 but haven t yet gotten around to implement due to the 1.0 release stuff. A good work plan for these both issues would be to first implement this change then extract all functionality except the connection initialization and related configuration settings to an abstract DatabasePersistenceManager base class and finally create a JndiDatabasePersistenceManager subclass that implements its own version of initConnection . PS. Would it be better to name the method something like getConnection At least to me init sounds more like initializing an existing connection while get or perhaps new is a more standard convention for factory methods. done svn r386638 .Thanks for the quick turnaround. You guys are awesome.
