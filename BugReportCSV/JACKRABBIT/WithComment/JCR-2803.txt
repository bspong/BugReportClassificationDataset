Deprecate non-pooled bundle DB persistence managers
In JCR-1456 and Jackrabbit 2.0 we introduced database connection pooling but decided to keep the existing database bundle persistence managers intact to avoid potential regressions. We haven t seen such problems even though pooled bundle persistence has been the default since the 2.0 release so I think it would be safe to deprecate all the non-pooled bundle DB PMs. And in order to remove duplicate code that has already complicated some changes within o.a.j.persistence I d also take the extra step of making the o.a.j.p.bundle. classes extend respective the o.a.j.p.pool. classes. This would automatically allow also old non-pooled configurations to benefit from connection pooling. old non-pooled configurations to benefit from connection pooling what s the configuration diff between those two or more specifically are there configuration parameters that only apply to non-pooled PMs what s the configuration diff between those two IIRC there are no configuration parameters in the non-pooled PMs that don t exist in the pooled counterparts. In case there are need to check that it should be easy to implement them also in the pooled versions.Done in revisions 1036356 and 1036365. I reviewed the configuration parameters and verified that all parameters supported by non-pooled bundle db PMs are also supported by the respective pooled versions.
