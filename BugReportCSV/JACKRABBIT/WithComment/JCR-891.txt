Add import-export tool
We at GX creative online development would like to contribute our command-line import-export tool to the Apache Jackrabbit project. This tool is capable of exporting and importing all kinds of repository content including custom nodetypes and namespace mappings in a persistence-layer independent way.Added the zip file with the project source code.nice thanks for the contribution cheers stefanCommitted the contributed sources to contrib jackrabbit-jcr-import-export-tool in revision 540416. Thanks I d like to see the tool included in Jackrabbit 1.4 so I ll probably follow up later on with a separate issue to upgrade the tool from contrib.
