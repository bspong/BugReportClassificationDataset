Jcr-Server missing-auth-mapping init parameter should have option for GuestCredential login
the missing-auth-mapping parameter of the servlets contained in jcr-server is defined as follows               param-value anonymous anonymous param-value               description                  Defines how a missing authorization header should be handled.                  1 If this init-param is missing a 401 response is generated.                     This is suiteable for clients eg. webdav clients for which                     sending a proper authorization header is not possible if the                     server never sent a 401.                  2 If this init-param is present with an empty value                     null-credentials are returned thus forcing an null login                     on the repository.                  3 If this init-param has a user password value the respective                     simple credentials are generated.               description JCR 2.0 introduces GuestCredentials used to obtain a anonymous session. Therefore we should probably extend modify the missing-auth-param in a way that allows to distinguish between - null-login - guest login in case of missing authorization header.Rescheduling to 2.0Do we need this for 2.0 or can we postpone to a later release Do we need this for 2.0 or can we postpone to a later release sure we can postpone it... on the other hand i think it shouldn t be too much of an effort... let s see if i can provide a patch this week.patch attached. if nobody objects i will commit it by end of this week.fixed in trunk as suggested and merged changes to the 2.0 branch
