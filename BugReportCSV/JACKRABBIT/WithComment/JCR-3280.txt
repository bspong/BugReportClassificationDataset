SQL2 joins on empty sets are not efficient
It seems that in the cases where the LEFT side of the join doesn t contain any hits the QueryEngine in unable to generate an efficient query for the RIGHT side so it basically select all the possible nodes. See this discussion as context 0 . Example LEFT side has hits RIGHT side select is fast given some conditions SQL2 JOIN LEFT SIDE took 18 ms. fetched 145 rows. SQL2 JOIN RIGHT SIDE took 67 ms. fetched 0 rows. LEFT side has no hits RIGHT select everything SQL2 JOIN LEFT SIDE took 8 ms. fetched 0 rows. SQL2 JOIN RIGHT SIDE took 845 ms. fetched 13055 rows. ...so it fetches 130k nodes and doesn t keep any of them. 0 http jackrabbit.510166.n4.nabble.com Strange-Search-Performance-problem-with-OR-td4507121.html proposed patch. it seems that if the left side is empty there is no real need to query the right side anyway. just for context right join queries are rewritten to left join before running. you re my hero. the queries are now fast. Will report if some issues pop up but testsuite ran without problemsyou are welcome fixed in revision 1306337.Nice This seems important and low-risk enough to be included already in 2.4.1 so I merged it to the 2.4 branch in revision 1306367.cool thanks Jukka
