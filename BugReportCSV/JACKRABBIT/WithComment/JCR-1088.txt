WorkspaceRestoreTest extends RestoreTest
WorkspaceRestoreTest extends RestoreTest in order to re-use variables and setUp tearDown code. On the other hand this causes all tests from RestoreTest that aren t overriden by WorkspaceRestoreTest to be run twice. Proposal decouple the classes copying over the interesting parts from RestoreTest into WorkspaceRestoreTest. Fixed with revision 569387.Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 577866.
