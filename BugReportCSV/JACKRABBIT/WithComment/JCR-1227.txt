Restore of empty multivalue property always changes property type to String
When you do a restore of empty multivalue property OPV COPY restored property always has the String type no matter of property type in frozen state . The solution is to set the property type from frozen state instead of retriving it from first value. If mulitvalue does not have any values the type is set to UNDEFINED and finally changed to STRING in restore method. Attached patch with test case.Fixed slightly differently in revision 628281 and merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 628282. Thanks Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 643423.
