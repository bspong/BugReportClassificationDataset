RFC4918 feature absolute paths in Destination and If headers
RFC4918 allows absolute paths instead of absolute URIs in the Destination and If headers http greenbytes.de tech webdav rfc4918.html rfc.section.14.8 gt . This makes it simpler to deal with situations where reverse proxies are involved because those usually are not aware of WebDAV request headers and do not rewrite them .Support for absolute paths was added as part of fixing JCR-1782. Support for absolute paths in the If header is sort of present already as the servlet currently ignores entries for resources other than the request URI see associated ticket JCR-1785 .Marking as fixes as the outstanding issue on JCR-1785 affects RFC2518 compliance as well.
