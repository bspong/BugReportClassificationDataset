registration of new namespace does not respect existing session mappings
consider the following starting with a default namespace registry remap nt namespace Session.setNamespacePrefix foobar http www.jcp.org jcr nt 1.0 create new namespace NamespaceRegistry.registerNamespace foobar http www.foo.org bar 1.0 now the session used above that remapped the nt namespace has an ambigous namespace mapping foobar http www.jcp.org jcr nt 1.0 http www.jcp.org jcr nt 1.0 foobar http www.foo.org bar 1.0 foobar i.e. the new foobar namespace is hidden for this session. either the registration should not work or an automatic prefix is to be defined in all local session mappings. I remember wondering about this same issue in another project some while ago. The JCR spec doesn t seem to indicate what should happen in such a case. The problem isn t localized to a single session as the namespace registrations are global and could thus mess with any number of active sessions that suddenly receive a new namespace mapping in the underlying namespace registry. Thus I think the registration should not fail as the client code would have no way of anticipating such failures. 1 to automatically remapping the new namespace for sessions that have already mapped some other namespace to the same prefix.i share jukka s concerns 1 to automatically remapping the new namespace for sessions that have already mapped some other namespace to the same prefix.fixed in svn r327199
