Add Bundle Persistence Managers
we day software offer our set of bundle persistence managers to the jackrabbit project. those pms combine the node and property states into a single bundle and store them together. this improves performance and reduces storage-memory overhead no exact numbers available . The bundle pms also have a bundle-cache that does a memory sensitive caching of the bundles and a negative cache for non-existent bundles. small binary properties are inlined into the bundle rather than stored in the blobstore.Patch that contains the new bundle persistence managers.Added Oracle-specific blob handling to the bundle OraclePersistenceManager which seems to work fine now.I m still waiting for the Day CCLA addendum to be recorded as received before I can proceed with the IP clearance process. Once the ASF secretary acknowledges the addendum as received I will call a vote on the Incubator PMC to confirm the IP as cleared. Once or if the 72 hour vote passes it s OK to commit the changes to svn. I ll keep you posted on the progress.The IP has been cleared and it s now OK to commit the changes to svn. The record of the IP clearance process is at http incubator.apache.org ip-clearance jackrabbit-bundle-persistence.htmlcomitted the code in r517150. i opened a new issue for the oracle problem JCR-786
