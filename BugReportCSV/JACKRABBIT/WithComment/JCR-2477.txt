Log trace wrapper upgrade to JCR API 2.0
The JCR Log wrapper jcrlog currently only supports the JCR 1.0 API. It should be upgraded to 2.0. Also the dependency to jackrabbit-core should be removed and generics should be used.I think this issue is fixed now. If it doesn t work for you please open a new bug
