Incorrect decodedAttributeValue in AbstractImportXmlTest
The string literal is not correctly escaped. Later on the decoded attribute value should be used to check the imported value. There is currently an odd test that checks the encoded attribute value twice.Fixed in revision 640763 Thank you Sergey for reporting this issue.
