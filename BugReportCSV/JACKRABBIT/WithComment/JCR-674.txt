String properties with invalid XML characters export as invalid XML
As noted in the current JCR 1.0.1 maintenance draft sections 6.4.1 6.4.2.6 XML export of string properties that contain invalid XML characters isn t well-defined currently since those characters are not permissible in XML. The proposed fix is to use base64 encoding for such values in System View. Most characters below x20 are examples of this. Currently these are escaped numerically in output such as amp 0 but such escape sequences can t be parsed by the XML import methods. The current behavior is particularly problematic because the user doesn t know the output is corrupt until later when they try to import it and get InvalidSerializedDataException. If for some reason the base64 option is delayed it might make sense as an interim solution to fail on export or to somehow patch import to relax its parsing and allow these escape codes.Hello there After short investigation we at Cognifide think that we know what the problem is - Not only values that should be base64 are not exported but also node and property names that have invalid characters in it e.g. most characters below 0x0020 are exported using entities that is still invalid . We are currently implementing patch for the first issue base64 . And a little more about invalid node property names it seems like the difference lies between Session.exportDocumentView and Session.exportSystemView. The first one seems to be doing it correctly. However the second does not use ISO9075 class that is responsible for encoding. Simply connecting exportSystemView to ISO9075 should make it we are also going to implement this . Any comments on this approach Patch is coming soon we hope . Regards ÊLiliana and JanOne more thought maybe we should split this issue into 2 - leave values encoding to base64 here - create new issue for names encoding in Session.exportSystemView. What do you think about it Agreed the encoding of names is a separate issue. Actually a pretty tricky one... Please open a separate issue for property names and let s keep this issue focused on property values.I have a question about adding namespaces to repository. We have to use xsi and xsd namespaces during XML generation see JSR170 1.0.1 - 6.4.1.7 . Currently all namespaces in the XML seem to come from repository namespaces - is that true We are a bit confused about adding xsi and xsd to reservedNamespaces collection. Currently Javadoc for javax.jcr.NamespaceRegistry.registerNamespace says nothing about xsi and xsd namespaces and suggests that they are perfectly legal to be added by a user Attempting to re-assign a built-in prefix code jcr code code nt code code mix code code sv code code xml code or the empty prefix to a new URI will throw a code NamespaceException code . Can we just and xsi and xsd namespaces to reservedNamespaces or will it raise compatibility issues If it is not a good solution then where would you suggest to put code responsible for adding those namespaces to XML Regards ÊLiliana and JanImplemented base64 encoding of non-binary properties containing non-XML characters for export with revision 533070.Resolved as fixed for Jackrabbit 1.4. See JCR-1228 for the request to add support for properly importing such base64 encoded values.
