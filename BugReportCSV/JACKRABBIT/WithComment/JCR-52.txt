First Steps document is outdated
As reported by Manoj Prasad on the development mailing list the code and configuration shown on the First Steps document 1 is no longer up to date with the latest Jackrabbit sources. The differences are     the Versioning element needs to be added to the repository configuration file     the output values printed by the examples have changes log messages new node types etc.     multiple values especially jcr mixinTypes properties are not handled correctly The document should be updated. 1 http incubator.apache.org jackrabbit firststeps.htmlDocument changes committed at revision 155110.Closing issue.
