Update slf4j
Please update slf4j from 1.3.0 to 1.5.2. jcl104-over-slf4j has been renamed as jcl-over-slf4j so if one uses a recent version he has to exclude jcl104-over-slf4j for every jackrabbit dependency which is quite a pain... No impact observed. Best regards Stephane LandelleWhat made you pick version 1.5.2 when version 1.5.3 is available I ve tested my assemblies using 1.5-SNAPSHOTs with the 1.5.3 versions of slf4j endstates and did not receive any errors.I just hadn t noticed that a new release was made 10 days ago. So 1.5.3 it is If you have a look at the jcl104-over-slf4j POM http svn.slf4j.org viewvc slf4j trunk jcl104-over-slf4j pom.xml view markup gt you ll see that it s deprecated and relocated to jcl-over-slf4j. So it would be cleaner to update the dependency and not only the version. Sincerely Stephane 2008 9 22 Micah Whitacre JIRA jira apache.org I m wondering if a better solution would be not to use jcl-over-slf4j at all in Jackrabbit i.e. leave it up to the client application to exclude the transitive commons-logging dependency with jcl-over-slf4j they want.I agree jackrabbit shouldn t in any way depend on jcl104-over-slf4j with a compile scope. Currently only jackrabbit-webapp and jackrabbit-text-extractor depend on jcl104-over-slf4j both with compile scope . Concerning jackrabbit-webapp scope should be runtime not compile as it is now. Concerning jackrabbit-text-extractor I don t understand why it depends on jcl104-over-slf4j in the first place. Should it be remove Should scope be changed to test Sincerely Stephane Landelle 2008 9 23 Jukka Zitting JIRA jira apache.org Updated the SLF4J dependencies to 1.5.3 in revision 698222. I reopened the JCR-1631 issue that introduced the jcl104-over-slf4j dependency to text-extractors. The rationale was to replace the transitive commons-logging dependency of Apache POI with SLF4J.
