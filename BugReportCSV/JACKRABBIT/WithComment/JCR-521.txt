Add a method public boolean hasNodeType String name in NodeTypeManagerImpl
As seen in the ML we plan to add this method and update this class and the interface JackrabbitNodeTypeManagerHere is the patch implementing those changes.Thanks One point though could you catch the internal NameExceptions in the method and convert them to RepositoryExceptions for symmetry with the JCR API methods The interfaces in o.a.j.api should have no dependencies outside J2SE and JCR.Sure. Here it is. Two stylistic issues still. I m probably more strict with you than with a random contributor but please bear with me. - a Using this. is usually redundant in normal method calls unless you explicitly want to draw attention to the fact that a method is invoked on this . b There are two extra empty lines being added by your patch. While they do no harm it is generally a good practice to trim any unnecessary modifications out of your patches before submitting them. Less clutter makes it easier to review the patch. Correcting A and BThanks for the updates. Committed with minor modifications in revision 426682.I think this issue is now closed
