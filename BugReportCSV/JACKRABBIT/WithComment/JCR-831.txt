NPE Exception Thrown By AbstractJournal During Commit Operation
This seems related to JCR-712 which was apparently fixed in 1.2.2 but I see the following error now-and-then on JR 1.2.2 I m using the DB based journal implementation with Oracle 10g java.lang.NullPointerException         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.cluster.AbstractJournal.commit AbstractJournal.java 525         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.cluster.ClusterNode.updateCommitted ClusterNode.java 424         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.cluster.ClusterNode WorkspaceUpdateChannel.updateCommitted ClusterNode.java 565         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.SharedItemStateManager Update.end SharedItemStateManager.java 712         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.SharedItemStateManager.update SharedItemStateManager.java 808         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.LocalItemStateManager.update LocalItemStateManager.java 326         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.XAItemStateManager.update XAItemStateManager.java 313         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.LocalItemStateManager.update LocalItemStateManager.java 302         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.SessionItemStateManager.update SessionItemStateManager.java 308         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.ItemImpl.save ItemImpl.java 1204         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.SessionImpl.save SessionImpl.java 823 This bug should have been fixed by the refactoring that took place while working on JCR-757 this version of AbstractJournal still relied on an instance variable named out that may or in exceptional cases may not have been initialized in the updateCreated updatePrepared callback methods. While I could see myself these errors now and then in the non-refactored version they disappeared after the resolving of JCR-757 which didn t make it into the 1.2.3 release though.
