Access control for repository level API operations
it is a open issue i guess since jackrabbit 1.0 that the repository level write operations lack any kind of permission check. this issues has been raised during specification of jsr 283 1 but didn t made it into the specification left to implementation . in jackrabbit 2.0 this affects the following parts of the API - namespace registration - node type registration - workspace creation removal based on a issue reported by david currently an anonymous user can write the namespace registry which is probably undesirable ... we could at least add some minimal restrictions. In addition i would like to take up this discussion for jsr 333. 1 https jsr-283.dev.java.net issues show bug.cgi id 486will add implementation following the specifications extensions added with issue 15 of JSR 333done for the default resource based access control implementation. apart from the repository operations defined by jcr api the registration of new privileges is controlled by the same mechanism replacing hardcoded check for editing session being admin
