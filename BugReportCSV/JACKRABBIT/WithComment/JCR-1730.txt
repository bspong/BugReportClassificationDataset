Background text extraction not possible when supportHighlighting is set true
There is an IndexingQueue that holds nodes that are indexed with a background thread when text extraction takes more time than a configurable limit. When supportHighlighting is set to true the IndexingQueue is never used because the text extract is immediately requested in NodeIndexer. Instead the text extract should be retrieved only when the node is added to the index.Fixed in trunk 694164 I d like to merge this change into the 1.4 branch for inclusion into the 1.4.6 release because this bug makes the background indexing useless when supportHighlighting is true. Any objections Forgot a check for LazyTextExtractorField. Fixed in revision 694185 I d like to merge this change into the 1.4 branch for inclusion into the 1.4.6 release because this bug makes the background indexing useless when supportHighlighting is true. OK by me. Merged into 1.4 branch in revision 694208
