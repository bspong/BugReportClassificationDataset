DefaultItemStateProvider contains grow-only cache
The DefaultItemStateProvider class contains a private HashMap items which contains references to ItemState objects. The bad thing about this cache is that it only grows but is not being managed to forget about unused items. Example A repository which is filled with 9350 nodes and 52813 properties grows this items map to 1 667 557 entries. In this concrete case the VM all13ates 213MB to the heap of which 57MB is referenced by the DefaultItemStateProvider.items map.as mentioned in jcr-20 a sophisticated caching is not implemented yet. the versioning is still in a prototype development phase and those issues are well known.fixed by revision 11518 - DefaultItemStateProvider removed and added VersionItemStateProvide - the VSP has no cache at all right now. this might slow down versioning operations a bit but does not consume any memory.closing resolved issue
