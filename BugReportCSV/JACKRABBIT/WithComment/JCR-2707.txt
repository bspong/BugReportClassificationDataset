improve performance when saving a node with a large number of child nodes e.g. 10k child node entries 
JCR-307 brought a significant improvement WRT saving nodes with a large number of child nodes unfortunately JCR-2579 broke part of the optimization see NodeState.setChildNodeEntries List .fixed in svn r984411I added a few performance benchmarks for this in revision 984475. I ll run them over night to get a better picture of where we are.Attached the results of the performance benchmark CreateManyChildNodesTest measures the time of creating a new node with 10k children UpdateManyChildNodesTest measures the time of adding a new child to an existing node with 10k children not sure what we did wrong in 2.0 TransientManyChildNodesTest measures the time of transiently adding and removing a single new child to an existing node with 10k children this I believe is where the effect of r984411 is visible
