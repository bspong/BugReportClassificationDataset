VirtualNodeTypeStateProvider creates PropertyState with type value s .getType
VirtualNodeTypeStateProvider creates the item states for the in content representation of the node type definitions and in case of jcr defaultValues hard codes the type of the property state thus the jcr property to PropertyType.STRING. the nt-definition of nt propertyDefinition however states that jcr defaultValues doesn t have a required type thus the type should rather be determined based on the values themselves. the current behaviour leads situations where Property.getType Property.getValues 0 .getType which from my point of view is a bug.if nobody objects i will commit the proposed fix within the next couple of days.Merged to the 1.5 branch in revision 779051.
