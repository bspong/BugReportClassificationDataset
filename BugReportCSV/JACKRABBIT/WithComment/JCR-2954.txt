SQL-2 query returns more than the requested column
If I do SELECT alias. jcr title FROM jnt mainContent as alias and then iterate through the returned columns of the rows I get the same result as for SELECT FROM jnt mainContent which is ALL the properties defined for jnt mainContent. Only if I use SELECT alias. jcr title as title FROM jnt mainContent as alias the result is limited to the title column.Add check for the case that propertyName is specified in the column without using an alias. In this case still just the column should be returned and not all columns.hi Benjamin interesting find I ve looked over this issue a little bit and the problem is better solved deeper in the Parser class in jcr-commons. I ve included a few tests take a quick look and let me know what you think.Fixed in revision 1126987.Merged to the 2.2 branch in revision 1202785.
