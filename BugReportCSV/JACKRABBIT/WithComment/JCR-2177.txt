Node.getWeakReferences throws UnsupportedOperationException if not referenceable
.... while Node.getReferences doesn t and returns an empty propertyiterator. From my point of view both methods should behave the same way and i prefer not throwing. added - shortcut to Node.getWeakReferences and Node.getWeakReferences String - testcase to jackrabbit-jcr-tests for both Node.getReferences and Node.getWeakReferences for non-referenceable nodes. NOTE the javadoc of both methods doesn t state the expected behaviour if called on a non-referenceable node. i ask for             clarification in the EG.
