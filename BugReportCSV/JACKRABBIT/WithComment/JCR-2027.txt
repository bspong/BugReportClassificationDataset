Remove background initialization of hierarchy cache
This is a follow up to JCR-1998. Rethinking the initialization in a background thread again I now come to the conclusion that it should be initialized either completely on startup or not at all. A background thread puts additional load on the process possibly fighting for I O with other startup procedures. Proposed patch.Applied patch to trunk in revision 756429IndexMigration always opens index readers without initializing the hierarchy cache which is OK but this prevents a later initialization based on the configuration parameter.Fixed in revision 761645
