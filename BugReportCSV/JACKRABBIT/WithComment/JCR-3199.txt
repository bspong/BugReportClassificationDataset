workspace-wide default for lock timeout
There should be a way to define a workspace-wide default for JCR lock timeouts in case the code creating the lock did not specify one .Proposed patch. - adds a defaultLockTimeout attribute to the Workspace element - parses it into WorkspaceConfig - uses it in NodeImpl.lock Q - dunno about how we version the DTD - do we need to maintain the previous 2 variants of the WorkspaceConfig constructor dunno about how we version the DTD they are listed in jackrabbit-core src main resources org apache jackrabbit core config. if i remember correctly it should be sufficient to add the additional elements there. since the latest version is 2.4 i don t think you have to create a new version. do we need to maintain the previous 2 variants of the WorkspaceConfig constructor not sure... i tend to be overly careful with such removals. but in any case we need to adjust the CRX specific overlay. ... and the patch looks goodMerged to the 2.4 branch in revision 1232546.
