JSR 283 References and Dereferencing of Property Values
References new methods are - Node.getReferences String name PropertyIterator - Node.getWeakReferences PropertyIterator - Node.getWeakReferences String name PropertyIterator Derferencing As of JSR 283 the following property types may be dereferenced to a Node - REFERENCE - WEAKREFERENCE - PATH - any type that can be converted to either of the types above The new method - Property.getProperty returns the Property pointed to by a PATH value. - any type that can be converted to PATH Addressed dereferencing both in jackrabbit-core and jackrabbit-jcr2spi at revision 772352     Property.getNode     Property.getProperty and adjusted the test cases in jackrabbit-jcr-tests accordingly. TODO - similar testcases for the new Property types still missing - new reference methods as listed above - support for weak-refsthe new api methods are implemented please open a new issue for tck test coverageIMO it would be a lot easier if we use the same JIRA issue for tests as well. Basically because code changes should always be accompanied with respective tests. I think creating separate JIRA issues adds overhead and we will likely forget to add those tests.
