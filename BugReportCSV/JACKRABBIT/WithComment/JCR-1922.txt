Validate the SearchIndex configuration
The validation of the configuration repository.xml workspace.xml was enabled in JCR-1462 unfortunately a problem with the LoginModule and SearchIndex was found see JCR-1920 so it was later disabled for those two modules. Validation for SearchIndex is possible but needs some more changes. To avoid problems those changes should be done in a major version and not in a minor version.The SearchIndex tag is now validated. There are also some other changes it s better if somebody reviews the changes before I commit them. 1 The patch looks OK.Committed in revision 734375 trunk .
