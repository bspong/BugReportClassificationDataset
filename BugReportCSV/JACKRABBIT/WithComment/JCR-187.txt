it is not possible to register an event listener which listens to mixin nodetypes
it would be a nice enhancement if one could as well define mixin nodetypes to be listened ... om.addEventListener this                         Event.PROPERTY ADDED Event.PROPERTY CHANGED Event.PROPERTY REMOVED                                                  true                         null                         new String mix Custom                         false ...Tagging this issue for 1.0 and relabeling it as a major bug. Is this problem still active I believe that this behaviour is against the JCR specification.This is still an unresolved issue and I think you are right that the filter must also respect mixin types.Fixed in revision 306651
