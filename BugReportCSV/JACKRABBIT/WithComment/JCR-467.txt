CompactNodeTypeReader fails to explain why valid JCR names cause errors
for example you cannot use underscores in node type definitions my example breaks2 In fact only A-Z a-z 0-9 are allowed unless you quote the name. The error message you see when you make this mistake doesn t give any hint Missing delimiter for end of node type name nodetypes.cnd line 8 and the documentation on the website and the javadoc for CompactNodeTypeDefReader both just say   unquoted string ...a string... ... not helpful. If you made this mistake you end up needing to look at the source to figure out what you ve done wrong. A few suggested solutions - change the documentation to say unquoted string is A-Za-z0-9 - change the error message to mention the token causing the problem eg if currentTokenEquals Lexer.END NODE TYPE NAME             lexer.fail Missing Lexer.END NODE TYPE NAME delimiter for end of node type name found currentToken - add st.wordChars to the lexer its probably going to be the most common cause and doesnt conflict with other rules. Fixed as suggested in revision 418446. Thanks a lot for the excellent bug report with an accurate fix
