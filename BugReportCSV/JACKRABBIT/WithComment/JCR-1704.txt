Indexing rules inheritance doesn t work
Indexing rules are supposed to be inherited by children node types. In org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.IndexingConfigurationImpl.init rules are registered for the declared node type and all its children. However as the rule s node type is still the original one the rule gets rejected in org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.IndexingConfigurationImpl IndexingRule.appliesTo. One simple solution would be to register not the original rule but a copy where the original node type has been replaced by the child one. Please find corrected class attached. Sincerely StéphaneThank you for reporting this issue. I ve committed a slightly changed version of the class you attached. svn revision 682409Great thank you 2008 8 4 Marcel Reutegger JIRA jira apache.org Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 695969.
