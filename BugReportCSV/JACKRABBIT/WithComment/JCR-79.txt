EventFilter misses Events for same Nodetype
If an ObservationListener registers with a NodeType-filter it only gets informed about events on Sub-NodeTypes of the ones specified in the filter but not on the NodeType itself. Example ObservationManager om wsp.getObservationManager om.addEventListener listener Event.PROPERTY ADDED true null new String nt unstructured true would receive notifications on nodes of type rep root which is based on nt unstructured but not of nt unstructured Thanks for reporting this issue Chris. This happens when the session registering the listener is not the same session that does the changes on the workspace. Unfortunately all test cases listen with same session for observation events and also do changes with that session so they did not fail.Fixed in revision 158602
