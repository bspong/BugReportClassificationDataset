Replace NodeReferencesId with NodeId
The NodeReferencesId class simply wraps a NodeId and forwards all essential method calls to it. The main only benefit of having NodeReferencesId as a separate class is the ability to distinguish between the overloaded exists and load method signatures on PersistenceManager. The downside is the need to instantiate all the NodeReferencesId wrapper objects whenever accessing the references to a node. I propose to rename the overloaded methods to hasReferencesTo NodeId and getReferencesTo NodeId and to replace the NodeReferencesId with just the target NodeId wherever used. Attached a proposed patch. The patch is pretty big as it s the result of about a dozen refactoring steps required to replace all references to NodeReferencesId. None of the steps introduced any functional changes so also the aggregate is pretty safe.in general 1 but i would keep the method names similar to avoid confusion   NodeReferences loadReferencesTo NodeId id   boolean existReferencesTo NodeId targetId Agreed good point.OK I committed the patch with the updated method names in revision 793243.
