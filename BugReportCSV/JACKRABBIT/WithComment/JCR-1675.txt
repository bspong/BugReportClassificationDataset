Provide names for constants in QueryConstants
For debugging logging and user interaction purposes QueryConstants should include descriptive names for the constants it provides.I saw that QueryConstants uses a rather tricky way to define constants int OPERATION NE VALUE OPERATION EQ GENERAL 1 This is really hard for debugging because you can t easily map a number to a constant. Is this what you mean If yes I suggest to assign explicit values as in int OPERATION EQ VALUE 11 int OPERATION EQ GENERAL 12 ... An alternative would be to use the enum pattern using singleton objects rather than int constants but that s more tricky in JDK 1.4 as enum is not supported. By the way the main advantage of int constants the ability to use switch case is never used in the code - if else if else everywhere.Suggested patchApplied patch in revision 677231 Thank you for providing the patch.Thanks for fixing this
