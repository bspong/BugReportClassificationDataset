Data Store Oracle fails to create the table
When using an Oracle database the following exception occurs when trying to create the table ORA.00902 invalid datatype The problem is that Oracle doesn t support the data type BIGINT. Instead LONG should be used.You re correct. But I used the following line in oracle.properties createTable CREATE TABLE tablePrefix table ID VARCHAR2 255 PRIMARY KEY LENGTH NUMBER LAST MODIFIED NUMBER DATA BLOB BTW I also had to modify db2.properties. Should we open a new issue Hi You are right of course NUMBER is correct. LONG doesn t work actually. db2.properties Yes please open an new issue.Fixed in revision 652306 trunk It would be great to have this fixed in 1.4.4 should I commit it to the 1.4 branch OK to commit to 1.4.4Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 653349.
