java.lang.Iterable support for RangeIterators
Make javax.jcr.RangeIterator extend java.lang.Iterable in order to enable foreach loops on implementations of RangeIterator.this is not possible because we cannot change the JCR API it makes no sense to define an Iterator iterable . usually collections are iterable.fair enough. But it would be nice if generics were supported such that the following would be possible Node root session.getRootNode for Node n root.getNodes    actions to perform or the equivalent with node properties and other range iterator based implementationsYou d have to request that for a new version of the JCR API which is defined by a JSR standards body https jsr-283.dev.java.net and http jcp.org en jsr detail id 283 ofr JCR 2.0 . This might be something for a JCR 3.0 but I don t know anything about the plans for it and if it won t be out before 2 or 3 years from now.Actually as discussed f2f this morning with Thomas what we could do is add a utility class in jcr-commons that does something like this     for Node child JcrUtils.childNodes node          ...      The childNodes method would be implemented like this quick draft     public static Iterable Node childNodes final Node node         return new Iterable Node                 public Iterator Node iterator                     return Iterator Node node.getNodes                                    We could have similar methods for all the child node and property access methods as well as other JCR iterators. Updated issue summary to match the scope suggested above.The o.a.j.commons.JcrUtils class now contains a set of utility methods that map between RangeIterators and typed Iterables. Resolving as Fixed.
