Deprecate org.apache.jackrabbit.api.JackrabbitNodeTypeManager in 2.0 and 1.6
The JackrabbitNodeTypeManager defines 3 methods that can be removed for version 2.0 since they are no longer needed     NodeType registerNodeTypes InputSource in throws SAXException RepositoryException     NodeType registerNodeTypes InputStream in String contentType throws IOException RepositoryException those deal with directly register nodetypes from a XML or CND source. since we don t want to support XML serialization any longer and the CND import can be easily done using the spi-commons CompactNodeTypeDefReader with the new JCR2.0 node type registration. if the XML is to be supported i suggest to detach the reader similar to the CND one.     boolean hasNodeType String name throws RepositoryException this is now in the JCR2.0 api 1Deprecated in revision 801255 in the 1.x branch.this has been requested for 2.0 but was never added to the JCR 2.0 component. i have the impression that this is half way done deprecation in 1.x . can we complete that for 2.0 and remove or at least deprecated the interface in trunk and the 2.0 branch I d keep JackrabbitNodeTypeManager for now as a deprecated API in 2.0. There are quite a few people using it and and keeping the interface around doesn t really cost us that much.agreed. if nobody objects i will - mark the interface deprecated in trunk and 2.0-branch - adjust the subject accordingly and - resolve this issue fixed.adjusted subject. was Remove org.apache.jackrabbit.api.JackrabbitNodeTypeManager in 2.0 and deprecate in 1.6I know this is an old issue but I don t understand why adding the deprecation in 1.6.X when this version is only compatible with JCR-1.0 and the NodeTypeManager interface doesn t offer any method for registering new nodes.
