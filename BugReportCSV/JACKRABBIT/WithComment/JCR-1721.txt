make collection element names configurable
- add jcrElementName to CollectionDescriptor and Collection annotation - make COLLECTION ELEMENT NAME protected instead of private patch against 1.4 branch Can you check the patch I cannot apply it on the head or on rev num 687290. Thankspatch against trunk Patch has been applied. Thanks and sorry for the delay. Unit tests are working. I modified the content class Page to use a typed List. Let me know if something is wrong.We have also to support the jcrElementName with the XML mapping fille.Not sure what you mean. The digester is using CollectionDescriptor - this should be enough or do I miss anything I have added jcrElementName paragraph to jcrmapping-sibling.xml and modified DigesterBeanDescriptorTest.testParentBeanConverter see line 268 . That means we also have a working test case. Oh yes I m stupid - I m sorry for the noise.Took me some time to update my OSGi Spring-based project from Jackrabbit 1.4 to 1.5-SNAPSHOT but everything works fine now. Thanks Christophe. Is there a chance to see OCM 1.5 released as OSGi bundle
