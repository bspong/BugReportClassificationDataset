TCK Node types selected by SetValueValueFormatExceptionTest may lead to incorrect test failure
During setup the test selects two node types one with a BOOLEAN property and one with a DATE property and creates nodes of these types as children of the target node. Having the TCK select these node types creates two problems First JSR-170 does not require an implementation to provide deterministic stable ordering of node types returned by NodeTypeManager. Consequently the node types selected during test setup may vary from run to run making test configuration difficult or impossible. Second if a repository imposes implementation-specific type constraints not discoverable through JSR-170 the TCK may select a node type inappropriate as a child of the test node. Proposal introduce configuration properties which if set override the property definition and node type selected by NodeTypeUtil. I re-wrote major parts of the test cases in SetValueValueFormatExceptionTest. All test cases are now configurable wrt node types and property names that should be used for the test. Fixed in svn revision 428041 Thank you for reporting this issue.
