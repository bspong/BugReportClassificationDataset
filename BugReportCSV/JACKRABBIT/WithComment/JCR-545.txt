New method on NodeTypeManagerImpl to reregister nodetypes
Add a method to NodeTypeManagerImpl to allow reregistering of existing nodetypes. The method takes an inputstream in either XML or CND format and registers all new nodetypes and reregisters existing nodetypes.This is a patch which adds the following method public NodeType registerNodeTypes InputStream in String contentType boolean reregisterExisting i don t like this method because the re registering of the nodetypes is not atomic i.e. they are not registered at once. if would rather have the internal registerNodeTypes NodeType nodetypes by extended to handle regegistering smoothly. but for the time beeing.... 1 for applying this patch applied patch with some trivial cosmetic modifications. thanks for providing the patch fixed in svn rev. 469959Targetting 1.2 instead of 1.1.1 since this is a new feature.
