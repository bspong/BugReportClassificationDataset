Tika regressions in 0.8
There are a few notable problems in Tika 0.8 namely TIKA-548 and TIKA-556 that may adversely affect users of Jackrabbit 2.2. Since we don t have a Tika 0.9 release available yet I ll add workarounds for these issues in Jackrabbit.Fixed in revision 1043618 and merged to the 2.2 branch in revision 1043623.
