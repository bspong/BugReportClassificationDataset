incompatible with newers versions of xml-apis
Apparently the newer version of the xml-api does not play nice with file objects passed in via a streamresult. So to get around this I have modified the jackrabbit code RepositoryConfig.java 311 to read                  transformer.transform                      new DOMSource template new StreamResult xml COMMENTED OUT                     new DOMSource template new StreamResult directory WORKSPACE XML A similar issue can be found here http forum.java.sun.com thread.jspa forumID 34 threadID 563077 and a somewhat similar issue can be found logged as a bug at sun http bugs.sun.com bugdatabase view bug.do bug id 5077403Fixed as suggested using xml.getPath instead of manually creating the file path in revision 292291. Thanks for reporting this issue
