Remove noLockHack in SharedItemStateManager
With the increased test coverage specifically the recently added multi-threaded tests I m reasonably confident that the noLockHack in SharedItemStateManager is not needed anymore. Attached patch removes the hack. All tests still pass including the daily integration tests.Is the fine grained locking strategy being tested No I didn t run the tests with the fine grained locking but the noLockHack was only supported by the DefaultISMLocking anyway. Removing it should not have an affect on the FineGrainedISMLocking.Assuming lazy consensus committed patch in revision 657031
