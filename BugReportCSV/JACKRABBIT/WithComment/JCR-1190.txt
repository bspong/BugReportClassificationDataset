QValueFactory improvements
1 Allow all create methods to throw RepositoryException. 2 Further document that create value type can throw ValueFormatException. 3 Remove special case create File Added exceptions to method signatures in r588666. 4 the current implementation in jackrabbit-spi-commons is not consistent regarding ValueFormatException.     It catches that NumberFormatException upon creating Double Long values and upon getDouble getLong converting     it to ValueFormatException.     However it does not apply the same logic for PropertyType.NAME and PropertyType.PATH. added javadoc for 2 rev. 598663 improve consistency of QValueFactory impl in spi-commons rev. 598665 4 julian what is the problem with 3 i just saw that the create File is used during Session.importXML.... so I am inclined to keep that method. apart from that this issue could be resolved fixed. please comment.won tfix for issue 3. apart from that the problems indicated in this issue are fixed.
