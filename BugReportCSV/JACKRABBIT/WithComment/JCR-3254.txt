make max size of CachingEntryCollector s cache configurable
To assist in analyzing the bottleneck it would be good if it was easy to change the max size currently hard-wired to 5000. Suggest to be pragmatic and do that through a system property.while i agree that it was useful for problem analysis i somehow dislike the idea of having the size configurable with the acprovider config. the main reason is that i wouldn t want to be stuck with that implementation which imo has some fundamental drawbacks e.g. perm eval only calculated on access . using a system property for analysis was fine for me if it was not part of an official release but only some sort of analysis-patch that is used temporarily.I think once we understand the problem fully and have a fix we can just nuke the system property. So it s really temporary.Could you shed some light on the problem and it s symptoms Or at least link the post in userlist related to this. Thx.Jan see the parent issue JCR-2950Oops. Missed the fact it was subtask. Thx.
