indexing-rules should allow wildcards for global property names
eg indexing-rule nodeType    property text property    property Text property indexing-rule defines that all properties named text and all that end with Text should be fulltext indexed. if the property name includes namespace prefixes wildcards are only allowed for any namespace. eg title but not j title Indexing configuration now allows to define a index-rule with a property name pattern. The pattern is limited to the local name and is a regular expression see java.util.regex . A regular expression for the prefix is not supported. Please note that you have to indicate in the configuration that you use a regular expression      index-rule nodeType nt unstructured          property isRegexp true . Text property      index-rule The default value for isRegexp is false. Implemented in revision 677952
