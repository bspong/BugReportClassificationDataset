Avoid item state reads during Session.logout 
This is a follow up issue for JCR-2231. There s a second CachingHierarchyManager attached to the LocalItemStateManager which it unregistered too late and causes reads on the SharedItemStateManager on Session logout. The hierarchy manager should be unregistered as listener before the state manager is disposed.Patches add test to jcr-benchmark suite and unregister the hierarchy manager before item state manager dispose which was actually called twice. First in SessionItemStateManager.dispose and then in WorkspaceImpl.dispose again.jcr-benchmark results current Test case Mean Sdev Min Max Count 1000 x login 82 115 47 1105 405 1000 x login .logout 87 84 53 406 575 1000 x logout after reads 128 94 100 1027 105 patched Test case Mean Sdev Min Max Count 1000 x login 80 114 46 1106 472 1000 x login .logout 87 84 52 353 581 1000 x logout after reads 34 96 15 1102 142 Added test to jcr-benchmark suite in revision 949722Applied jackrabbit-core patch in revision 949724
