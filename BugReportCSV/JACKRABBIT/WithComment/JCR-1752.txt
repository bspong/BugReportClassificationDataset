Allow users to disable validation
DigesterMapperImpl leaves validating set to default true when creating a DigesterDescriptorReader. But as the dtd is not available anywhere published or in the source it is usually not declared in mapping files and DigesterDescriptorReader complains about it. Could it be possible to leave the user a way to configure the validation The simpliest way would be to add this constructor to DigesterMapperImpl     public DigesterMapperImpl InputStream streams boolean validate         descriptorReader new DigesterDescriptorReader streams         DigesterDescriptorReader.class.cast descriptorReader .setValidating validate         this.buildMapper      Best regard Stephane LandelleI just added your patch. I also create a new jira issue see JCR-1754 for creating for OCM 1.5 DTD.Great thanks 2008 9 22 Christophe Lombart JIRA jira apache.org
