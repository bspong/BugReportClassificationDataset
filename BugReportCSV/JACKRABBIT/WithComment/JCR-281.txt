textfilters module patch Support for text extraction for HTML XML and RTF files
This patch adds text extraction support form XML RTF and HTML files. The unique dependency is htmlparser library for handling HTML text extraction.Here is the patch.Thanks for the patch but htmlparser is LGPL. We can t use it until the owners use a license that is applicable to Java libraries. Hmm that s too bad. I m still a bit confused what kind of libraries we may use for apache projects. Roy is there a list of licenses that are compatible with the apache license Just to make sure we don t spend too much time in the future for extensions that we cannot include. Thanks. Would it be ok with you Martin to remove the HTML filter from the patch The XML and RTF filters are still very good contributions that I d like to include.you might want to reuse the HTMK Parser from Lenya http svn.apache.org repos asf lenya branches BRANCH 1 2 X src java org apache lenya lucene html resp. http svn.apache.org repos asf lenya branches BRANCH 1 2 X src java org apache lenya lucene parser which is under Apache license but might need some improvement.Martin I quickly checked the web and there are some alternatives that you might want to consider for parsing html - javax.swing.text.html.parser.Parser part of the 1.4 JDK - http www.apache.org andyc neko doc html apache license There is no problem I understand what you say Roy. I ll try to replace htmlparser with another solution. Personally I prefer to use a third party library because it will be faster and more effective. Give some time to evaluate Neko and other alternatives. I have updated the HTMLTextFilter class. Now it uses NekoHTML http www.apache.org andyc neko doc html parser and Xerces. Both are on iblibio so there is no need to manually download any jar. Committed the modified patch with minor formating changes. Thanks for the contribution. I d like to add you to the list of contributors. Is that ok with you Martin
