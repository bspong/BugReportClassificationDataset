Deleting binary property does not remove blob file in filesystem
when deleting a binary property or its containing node the blob-file sometime does not get removed. the reason for this is an open FileInputStream that gets referenced in the property value.fixed in r179772 but needs verificationAdded a HandleMonitor r180286 that can be used with the LocalFileSystem. it traces all opens and reports a stacktrace of the allocation points if the file cannot be deleted. to enable it set the enableHandleMonitor param to true          FileSystem class org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.local.LocalFileSystem              param name path value wsp.home              param name enableHandleMonitor value true          FileSystem Since this issue is only a problem when using the LocalFS for blobs on windows boxes i added a LazyFileInputStream that opens the file not until the first file access is made. fixed rev 180292
