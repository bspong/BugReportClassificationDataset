Creation of JavaDoc fails on jackrabbit-jcr-server
The creation of JavaDoc fails on project jackrabbit-jcr-server if the command mvn javadoc javadoc is called on the latest checkout of jackrabbit. See attached log...That s a bug in the javadoc doclet implementation see http bugs.sun.com bugdatabase view bug.do bug id 5093723 .As a workaround to the JDK problem I added explicit class names to all the troublesome link method links. Thus fixed in revision 511533. Thanks for the problem report and the link to the Java regression
