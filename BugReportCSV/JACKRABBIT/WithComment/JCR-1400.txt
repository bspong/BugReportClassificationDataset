Backport JCR-940 add db connection autoConnect for BundleDbPersistenceManager
Backport issue JCR-940 add db connection autoConnect for BundleDbPersistenceManager to 1.3 branch for 1.3.4 separate issue to avoid re-opening JCR-940 which was already released with 1.4 .Patch for the 1.3 branch. Also includes https issues.apache.org jira browse JCR-1116 backported for the bundle PMs ie. excluding persistence db DatabasePersistenceManager which got logging in JCR-1116 as well .Applied the product patch without the JCR-1116 changes in revision 631371. I committed the JCR-1116 changes separately in revision 631379 and will use the JCR-1116 issue itself to track that change in the 1.3.4 release notes. Added the test case from JCR-1419 in revision 631397 and supporting code from JCR-1412 in revision 631382. Note that the test case doesn t work on Windows and I have some other issues about it but I ll follow up in JCR-1419 about that. For the 1.3.4 release I think the current test is fine. Resolving as Fixed. Thanks for the great work
