Mavenize Project
Mavenize project pending mailing list feedback. I m attaching an out-dated zip that has some useful stuff to review or build upon. Proposed flow 1 Review the maven specific elements in the zip - project.xml header.txt license.txt notice.txt checkstyle.xml project.properties xdocs directory. NOTE I know the license.txt and maybe header.txt are not correct per earlier discussions. 2 Once new package layout code is in svn - we can refactor this and move the maven related files into place. Thoughts   a One of the artifacts generated is the bat file and supporting directory with the jar to run the sample app - could use some ideas on how maven should generate this.   b How the local maven repo gets the jcr-api.jar My current thinking is same as any non-redistributable artifact . The user is responsible for downloading it to a local repository.Reminder - I ve left the outdated sources in here so it builds but ignore. This just starting point for possible maven files.Is this done It works great so far.Initial mavenization complete. change update as needed on an ongoing basis For general guidance on using maven on a project http i-proving.com 2007 04 25 how-to-use-maven-on-your-project or to split your project into smaller ones with Maven http i-proving.com 2007 03 29 split-your-project-into-sub-projects
