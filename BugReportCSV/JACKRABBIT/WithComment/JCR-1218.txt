RepositoryUtil moved outside of main source tree
It appears that the RepositoryUtil class was moved from src main to src test. This class is used by the ocm-spring project.basically need to move jcr-mapping src test java org apache jackrabbit ocm repository RepositoryUtil.java to jcr-mapping src main java org apache jackrabbit ocm repository RepositoryUtil.java RepositoryUtil IMHO has two issues with regards to JCR OCM 1 It creates a dependency on Jackrabbit-Core which is very bad and 2 it provides utility code of which I am not sure whether it is correctly placed inside the JCR OCM. Therefore I suggest to not move this class back into the JCR-OCM library. What exact functionality is ocm-spring being dependent Agree with Felix. I copied this class into the Spring subproject until wr find a better solution The RepositoryUtil class is IMHO outside the scope of OCM and thus shouldn t be included in src main. Resolving this as Won t Fix.The issue is not to add RepositoryUtil to src main but to remove it because we all agree that it does not belong there - Actually this has been done by Christophe therefore I assign this issue to him in Rev. 578997. So I close this issue fixed.The problem with there is that the spring part of the ocm project relies on the repository util class. If we do not want this class to exist we need to refactor the spring code and then remove it.This is why Christophe copied the class to the spring module too. So the class is available in the spring module for the moment as noted in the log message to Rev. 578997 as long as a better solution is found there. Hope this helps.
