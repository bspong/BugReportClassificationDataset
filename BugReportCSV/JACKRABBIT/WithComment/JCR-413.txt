JCA will not compile with J2EE1.3 classes
In JCAManagedConnectionFactory the constructor invoked to throw ResourceException does not exist under J2EE1.3 JCA1.1 classes.  throw new ResourceException e - line 136 and line 277. Instead the code needs to do something like             ResourceException exception new ResourceException Failed to create session             exception.setLinkedException e             throw exception This will allow it to compile run under J2EE1.3 Fixed in revision 418448. Thanks for reporting this The checkin to JCA-736 again adds a second parameter to the javax.resource.ResourceException constructor which breaks compatibility with J2EE 1.3.Good point I opened a new issue JCR-761 for the problem introduced in JCR-736 and re-closed this issue to avoid confusing the list of fixes in the 1.1 release.
