CachingIndexReader.initializeParents does not scale well with large indexes
On a 40 GB index that I m testing with the time to initialize the parents cache is 40 minutes. This is way to much needs optimization and should be done in a background thread.Optimized initialization of parents cache. The time dropped from 40 minutes to 90 seconds for the above mentioned index. Initialization is now done in a background thread which means the startup of the repository is not delayed anymore. Fixed in revision 721495Merged into 1.4 branch together with changes from JCR-1337 in revision 748135
