Consolidate compare behaviour for Value s and Comparable s 
There are 2 different implementations of Value comparison ValueComparator and Util . With the introduction of JCR-2906 which introduces arrays into the mix I d like to refactor all of them into one place namely o.a.j.core.query.lucene.Util. This will also allow for a wider scope of comparison for Value marked as TODO in the ValueComparator class. Will attach patch shortlyproposed patchLooks good to me. I quickly applied the patch and all tests passed. The only thing we could probably do is to move all comparison related methods from the Utils class to a dedicated utility class. I m not too sure about this however.Cool thanks for the feedback Michael I agree that Utils could use some refactoring as well maybe next time. I ll apply the patch shortlyfixed in revision 1209402
