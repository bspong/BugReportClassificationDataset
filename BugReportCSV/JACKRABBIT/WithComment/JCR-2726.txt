Make collecting group membership information lazy
JCR-2710 added a more scalable content model for storing group membership information. To further leverage the new model it would be preferable when group membership collecting where lazy. i.e. Group getDeclaredMembers and Group getMembers should not construct the list of all members up front . Fixed at revision 989102Here are some performance measurement from the GroupGetMembersTest added with JCR-2727. Collecting group membership eagerly i.e. before revision 989102 GroupGetMembersTest avg std min max count 2.2-btree-usermanager-repository 43 11 38 196 1167 2.2-default-usermanager-repository 26 3 24 74 1900 Collecting group membership lazily i.e. after revision 989102 GroupGetMembersTest avg std min max count 2.2-btree-usermanager-repository 19 2 16 49 2692 2.2-default-usermanager-repository 13 3 11 86 3801
