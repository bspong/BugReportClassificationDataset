H2PersistenceManager no need to call shutdown javadoc bugs
The H2PersistenceManager implementation calls shutdown to force closing the database when using file based databases. There is no need to do that when using the H2 database engine the database is closed automatically when the last connection is closed. Also the javadocs of the H2PersistenceManager need to be fixed. Fixed in revision 650142.Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 650526.
