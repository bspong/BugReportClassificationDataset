Java 1.4 compile error in Eclipse
As reported by Ate Douma in JCR-804 the revision 520841 introduced code that causes the Eclipse compiler to fail in Java 1.4 compliance mode. However the same code compiles with the Sun JDK 1.4. The problem is a enclosing class reference that an anonymous innner class instantiated in the constructor of a named inner class contains. Apparently and understandably in Eclipse 1.4 complier the instance references are not yet available when evaluating the super arguments in the constructor.Fixed in revision 526677 by replacing the ScorerFactory interface with an abstract createScorer factory method. The solutions are functionally equivalent but this one avoids the anonymous inner factory instances that were causing trouble to Eclipse.
