Provide more options for OCM CRUD API Writers to enhance the functionality
I am working on an Extension to Object Content Manager and from that angle require a few methods and variable from the base classes to be exposed with protected access. I have modifier only the getters and these should not cause any issues to the current functionality. Request a review and addition to the trunk. 1. added a clone implementation to FilterImpl 2. Exposed public CollectionConverter getCollectionConverter Session session CollectionDescriptor collectionDescriptor from ObjectConverterPatch applied. Thanks. Let me know if something is wrong. I m still interesting to know what kind of extension you are writing - Assign this issue to the ocm component
