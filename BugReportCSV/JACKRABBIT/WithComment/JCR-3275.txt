Audit log
JCR-2031 added the user name and path in debug logs for audit purposes. There are some problems with the fix that I had outlined in the comments for JCR-2031 and provided a patch. Additionally it would use useful to add an update counter and size information to the debug log as well. Something like this 17.03.2009 14 43 37 1 18216140 admin apps acme templates contentpage thumbnail.png 12343 17.03.2009 14 43 37 2 18216141 admin apps acme templates contentpage my.png 123 17.03.2009 14 43 37 3 18216142 admin apps acme templates contentpage blah.png 1423 17.03.2009 14 43 37 4 18216143 admin apps acme templates contentpage test.png 123423 17.03.2009 14 43 37 5 18216144 admin apps acme templates contentpage test2.png 123423 date time counter txid userid path size We should also think about whether we want this log as part of regular jackrabbit log or in a separate audit log. Patch provided in JCR-2031 looks good. Committed in revision 1305269Patch that adds counter and size support.The attached patch adds counter and size info to the debug log. Could someone with commit rights review and apply it please The latest attached patch further improves the logs with additional info.Looks very good. I slightly changed where new data store items are logged. In your patch the BundleWriter logs a message when a node with a binary property is stored. This will also log when a node is updated but the binary didn t change. I think this is confusing for a person looking at the log. Instead I moved the log statement to the class BLOBInDataStore. There the message will only be logged when a binary is actually added to the data store. Comitted in revision 1308743Re-opening because the log messages are only written on the cluster node where the changes are written. I think this is confusing because it will result in log information scattered across the cluster nodes.Patch provided by Mete Atamel to address the above mentioned limitation.Applied patch in revision 1329195I would like to change the audit logs in ClusterNode also to debug like the other ones or is it needed as info for someone changed to debug in revision 1352794.Hi Claus we had set ClusterNode s audit log to info because it s the most useful one for audit purposes and not so chatty. We wanted to make sure it s logged by default so we have useful audit info by default without people having to change to debug level. Other audit logs are at debug as they are more chatty and we didn t want the whole system to be overwhelmed with so many logs.Ok i see .. but i think the logs are also chatty because it logs every change on node level in the repo - .. and we could add some speaking log and not only some values as used in other audit logs. I have changed it to debug but if you need it as info please feel free to change it backYes they are somewhat chatty but that s the nature of audit logging. I m not sure if I follow your comment about speaking log. I think for audit logging to be useful its basic form i.e. ClusterNode part needs to be logged at info level. Not many people want to enable debug logging which means no audit logging for majority of use cases and that defeats the purpose. So I suggest we change ClusterNode audit logging back to info so at least we have some audit log by default. I d do it myself but I don t have commit rights - You are right its the nature - and so i thought we should have all audit logs at same level. You are right audit log should be logged in basic form but i don t like to have different formats. At the moment we have audit logs in ClusterNode AbstractBundlePersistenceManager and BLOBInDataStore. Two on debug level and one on info level. One looks like Stored to DataStore and the other one in ClusterNode looks like This is what i meant with speaking log ... We should document what values are logged or not. I m also in favour of changing it back to info. Please also note that this issue has fix version 2.5 which has already been released. We should not make changes anymore with this issue but rather create a new one. Otherwise it s not clear anymore what the behaviour is in a given release.Ups sorry .. i will change it back and open a new one .. so that we may use in all audit logs a similar log style.Additional comment enhancement proposal When saving several transaction at the same time the Audit log could log all nodes impacted by the commits. For example using CRXDE Lite I created 2 nodes tmp test and tmp test subtest . On save I see only one line 10.10.2012 12 04 37.795 DEBUG 10.136.133.138 1349863477688 POST crx server crx.default jcr 3aroot HTTP 1.1 org.apache.jackrabbit.core.cluster.ClusterNode revision 1099516356096 admin tmp
