Contrib JCR-Server enable PROPPATCH for simple-davresource
implement as suggested - jcr-properties are exposed as webdav properties - PROPPATCH is forwarded to javax.jcr.Property.setValue and Item.remove comitted changes. revision 230680doPropPatch in AbstractWebdavServlet still needs to send back a multistatus 207 response even in the successful case. I didn t see a way to collect the success failure status for each property but instead created a multistatus response and added a propstat SC OK for each of the properties in the setProperties and removeProperties. This allowed a WebDAV client which expected a multistatus response from PROPPATCH to work correctly with jcr-server. In the more general case the actual property status code will need to be used .i noticed this issue as well yesterday. there s a related issue which i will add to jira about allowing modification of protected properties.
