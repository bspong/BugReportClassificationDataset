System-view export import of multi-value property does not respect JCR 2.0
JCR 2.0 has a defined specification about system-view export of multi-value properties when these property have only one value. The attribute sv multiple attribute of sv property tag is not written in output stream result. Anyway if I add that one manually and try to import the modified system-view multi-value properties with an only value are not recognized and these properties are simply stored like a single-value ones. fixed in revision 943567 thanks for reporting this issue there s still a backwards compatibility issue. see http hudson.zones.apache.org hudson job Jackrabbit-trunk org.apache.jackrabbit jackrabbit-jcr-rmi 1140 fixed in revision 944294
