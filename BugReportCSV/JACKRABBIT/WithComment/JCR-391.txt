WebDAV method invocation trying to create a new resource should fail with 409 Conflict if parent resource does not exist
This is Litmus test case copy nodestcoll. An attempt is made to COPY an existing resource to a new location where the parent collection of the resource-to-be-created does not exist. RFC2518 asks for status code 409 Conflict instead of 403 Forbidden in this case. hi julian if i remember correctly the reason for this is that JSR170 does not allow to perform a shallow copy. the conflict would be detected by the javax.jcr.Workspace copy therefore no additional check for existing parent is performed. If you think this is worth an extra check i would add it to the AbstractWebdavServlet where some basic validation of the destination is done. regards angelaAngela confirmed modifying the Litmus test case to use Depth Infinity shows that in this case the correct response code is returned. Will investigate further. Best regards JulianOK as Angela pointed out this is because Litmus is trying a shallow copy which currently isn t implemented. Returning 403 in this case is correct. However there seems to be a very simple workaround which does not only make Litmus happy but may also help in some real-world cases only reject the request here if the source resource indeed is a collection otherwise WebDAV semantics for Depth 0 and Depth Infinity are identical . attached applied patch as is rev. 393731 thanks for your effort Merged for 1.0.1 in revision 409539.
