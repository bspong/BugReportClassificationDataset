Allow basic regexp in namespace prefix of index-rule
Currently a regular expression is limited to the local name which makes fallback declarations that should match everything else difficult to write. I.e. you have to write a line per namespace in the node type registry which bloats the index-rule unnecessarily. Currently property isRegexp true . property will only match properties with the empty namespace URI. I propose we allow a basic regular expression in the prefix. That is the match all pattern . dot star . The following would match any property including any namespace property isRegexp true . . property Proposed patch.Fixed typo in test.Applied patch with minor changes added license header to test config files . svn revision 898042Merged into 2.0 branch in revision 898056
