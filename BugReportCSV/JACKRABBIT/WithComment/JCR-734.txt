Update namespace uri for prefix fn
The SearchManager class still uses an outdated namespace uri for the fn prefix http www.w3.org 2004 10 xpath-functions The prefix should be re-mapped to the now offical namespace http www.w3.org 2005 xpath-functions See http www.w3.org TR xquery-operators namespace-prefixes To keep a minimum of backward compatibility the existing namespace uri should still exist in the namespace registry but refer to another prefix. E.g. fn old.On startup the fn prefix is mapped to the offical namespace uri http www.w3.org 2005 xpath-functions. If there exists a namespace uri that is already mapped to fn the existing namespace uri will be re-mapped to a different prefix to avoid collision. Fixed in revision 504206
