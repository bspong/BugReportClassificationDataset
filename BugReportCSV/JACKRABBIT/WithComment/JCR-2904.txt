Uncaught AbstractMethodError exception in in DomUtil.createFactory 
DomUtil.createFactory throws an uncaught AbstractMethodError exception when xerces is on the classpath and the jackrabbit webdav module is used. This can render the class unusable when used in conjunction with the xerces library. This patch has a fix for the listed bug and also a fix for another issue that allows the injection of alternate DocumentBuilderFactory which allows developers to address the issue described here http www.w3.org blog systeam 2008 02 08 w3c s excessive dtd traffic In the 2.1.3 version supported the injection of a DocumentBuilderFactory because BUILDER FACTORY was public. The patch adds a setter for this property rather than making it public.Thanks for the fix I committed a slightly modified version in revision 1079314. Merged to the 2.2 branch in revision 1079315.Oops my modifications were actually incorrect. I tried catching all Exceptions instead of just these two cases but the other one was an Error so would not have been caught by my code. I revised the code to better match your original patch in revision 1079317 and merged it to 2.2 in revision 10709318.
