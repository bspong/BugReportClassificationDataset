Automatic upgrade to 2.0
Jackrabbit 2.0 contains some changes that are not compatible with repositories created with earlier versions. It would be nice if Jackrabbit would automatically detect and upgrade repositories created with 1.x versions.Another Jackrabbit 2.0 blocker.I updated the Jackrabbit compatibility test harness and it reports no more failures when opening Jackrabbit 1.x repositories with Jackrabbit 2.0. Thus resolving as Fixed.reopening.... from what i remember we have backwards compatibility issues introduced by JCR-1944 the property type of privileges has changed from STRING to NAME between 1.5 and 1.6.                      so upgrading from 1.5 is prone to be problematic. JCR-2313 the issue lists a couple of areas that could cause problems. I m not sure if there is anything we have to do about those. but I would feel comfortable if we could test these and - if they really turn out to be problems - at least state it somewhere. thanks I added a backwards compatibility section the the Jackrabbit 2.0 release notes and included the following     Repositories that have used the new JSR 283 security features included     as a development preview in Jackrabbit 1.5 and 1.6 may face problems     when upgrading to Jackrabbit 2.0. See especially JCR-1944 and JCR-2313     for more details. I guess that s enough for now on this issue so resolving as fixed.
