Introduce similarity function
The query handler should support a similarity function that allows one to find nodes that are similar to a given existing one. Example rep similar foo bar Finds nodes that are similar to node foo bar.Added function rep similar abs path string I copied the MoreLikeThis class from the lucene similar contribution in order to not create a new dependency. To work properly this function requires that the parameter supportHighlighting is set to true . If the parameter is not set the rep similar function will not match any similar nodes. Committed in revision 536515Should also support a relative path argument just like jcr contains .Committed in revision 537767 The rep similar function now has the following syntax rep similar relative-path abs-path-string E.g. the initial example must now be written as rep similar . foo bar it is now also possible to find node that have a child node similar to another node rep similar foo foo bar finds all nodes that have a foo child node similar to the node at path foo bar.
