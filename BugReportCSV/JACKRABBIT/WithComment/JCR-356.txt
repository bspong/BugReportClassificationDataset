Replace license headers with new policy text
We need to replace all of the license headers with a new template that replaces the Copyright and license lines with BEGIN PROPOSED SOURCE FILE HEADER   Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation ASF under one or more   contributor license agreements. The ASF licenses this file to You   under the Apache License Version 2.0 the License you may not   use this file except in compliance with the License.   You may obtain a copy of the License at       http www.apache.org licenses LICENSE-2.0   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing software   distributed under the License is distributed on an AS IS BASIS   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND either express or implied.   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and   limitations under the License. END PROPOSED SOURCE FILE HEADER The copyright line is being removed from files due to legal advice from ASF attorneys. It is replaced with a statement that the copyright owners have licensed it to the ASF. Done. The ASF board just changed the license header text added a sentence .          RESOLVED that the NOTICE file shall begin with the following          text suitably modified to reflect the product name          and year s of distribution of the current and past releases            Apache PRODUCT NAME            Copyright yyyy The Apache Software Foundation            This product includes software developed at            The Apache Software Foundation http www.apache.org .                      and be it further          RESOLVED that files licensed to The Apache Software          Foundation shall be labeled with the following notice            Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation ASF under one            or more contributor license agreements.

I ll start working on the changes. I have done trunk. Should I do the jackrabbit-1.0 branch as well or wait until after the 1.0.1 release The 1.0 branch is OK for changes now though I don t plan to make any more releases from that branch.No need to update the old branch.
