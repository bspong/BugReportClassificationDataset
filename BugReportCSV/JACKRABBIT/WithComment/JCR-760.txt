Default blob size for mysql ddl too small
the default datatype for NODE.NODE DATA PROP.PROP DATA REFS.REFS DATA in the mysql ddl is BLOB which is pretty small to the default size in other dbs. When playing with a not very large jackrabbit repo using mysql for persistence I easily got data truncation errors on both NODE.NODE DATA and PROP.PROP DATA columns. The same issue has been reported in the past by other users. Although anyone could easily create a custom ddl with larger fields it should be nice to increase the blob size in the mysql ddl embedded in jackrabbit in order to avoid this kind of problems for new users you usually learn this the hard way when the number of nodes in your repository starts to grow and jackrabbit start throwing errors . Changing BLOB to MEDIUMBLOB will make the default size for mysql more similar to the one in other dbs without critically increasing the used space... patch for mysql.ddl blob- mediumblob fixed as suggested in svn r510537 thanks
