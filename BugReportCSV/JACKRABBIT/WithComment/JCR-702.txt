Allow database as backend for clustering
Currently clustering see JCR-623 uses a shared file system folder in order to store modifications and synchronize all nodes in the cluster. Alternatively a database backend should be available.Added a new journal implementation that remembers changes in the database. Verified with the following databases Derby Network Server H2 and Oracle. Sample cluster configuration looks as follows Derby Cluster    Journal class org.apache.jackrabbit.core.cluster.DatabaseJournal      param name driver value org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver      param name url value jdbc derby localhost 1527 jackrabbit create true     Journal   Cluster Further configuration details are available in DatabaseJournal s javadoc. Fixed in revision 495240.
