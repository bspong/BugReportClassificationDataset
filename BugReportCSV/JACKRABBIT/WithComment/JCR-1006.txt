StackOverflowError if too many versions of a node are created
In org.apache.jackrabbit.core.version.VersionIteratorImpl addVersion is called recursively which can cause StackOverflowErrors if there are too many versions.This patch collects all version ids iteratively instead of recursively to avoid StackOverflowErrors.Do we have actual use cases where a single version history consists of thousands of versions Sounds a bit academic to me but I guess it s a reasonable corner case and the patch seems good. Tail recursion... - We actually ran into this issue on one of our production system where we have to keep all published versions of a document. The specific document had more than 1000 versions and since our stack size is a bit smaller than the default this led to a StackOverflowError which caused the whole Jackrabbit engine to hang Patch committed in revision 558167 and merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 558173.
