Move MemoryJournal from test to main
Running our tests with the FileJournal implementation on a windows box can be quite slow because of the many FileDescriptor.sync calls.

That way we can use it in other test setups. 1 Sounds reasonable. 1 for MemoryJournal ... and at some point we should try to get rid of the FileDescriptor.sync calls.Done in revision 791457
