Jackrabbit web page scroll is slow with Firefox
When I visit http jackrabbit.apache.org from my Firefox in Ubuntu the browser scroll is very slow and make CPU go to 100 . The problem seems to be the fixed attribute in the css background definition so it should be removed. body   background white url bg.png repeat-x fixed center bottom   font-family Verdana Helvetica Arial sans-serif   font-size small   margin 0pt   padding 0pt Fixed in revision 638043. Thanks for the reminder Thank you for fixing it
