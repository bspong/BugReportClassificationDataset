SQL2 Join with OR clause still has some issues
There are still some issues with Joins that have OR clauses in them. I changed the test so that it reflects the changesFixed in revision 1138141.Backported to 2.2 in revision 1138142.The initial fix had some regression problems. I fixed that also added a new test. on trunk in revision 1142693 on 2.2 in revision 1142696 .incomplete fix. there are still usecases that do not work.finally closing this as the tests seem to be ok
