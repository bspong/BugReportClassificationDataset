 PATCH DbDataStore Make sure streams are closed
Stream isn t closed on end of use. this patch fixes it.i would use http commons.apache.org io api-release org apache commons io IOUtils.html closeQuietly java.io.InputStream Of course you are right the input stream should be closed. Did you experience a problem if it is not Or it the patch just because it should be closed In any case it will be fixed but not sure if it makes sense to fix in 1.4.1. To Tobias Jackrabbit doesn t have a dependency to IOUtils is it OK if I add it to the pom.xml and to http jackrabbit.apache.org doc firststeps.html list of dependencies Committed in revision 620783. To avoid adding a new class or dependency now just close is called.I moved the InputStream.close call to a finally block in revision 628263. I also removed the extra BufferdInputStream wrapper as Properties.load already buffers the input. I classified this as a minor bug as all streams should be properly closed. Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 628266.
