Node.removeMixin fails if the mixin defines a protected child node
Node.removeMixin fails if the mixin to removed defines a protected child node.... the problem is caused by line 253 of RemoveMixinOperation.FWIW this issue is a regression of JCR-890 i.e. the refactoring involved r982520 . there might be more hidden issues like this. FWIW this issue is a regression of JCR-890 i.e. the refactoring involved r982520 . I don t recall making any functional changes when refactoring this code I explicitly tried to avoid regressions but it may be that I missed something. AFAICT the entire loop around line 253 of RemoveMixinOperation is identical to the one in NodeImpl.removeMixin before revision 982520. Where s the regression Ah nevermind I see that Angela already fixed this. I d changed the name of the childNode variable to node which shadowed the similarly named variable from the surrounding scope. Sorry about that. -
