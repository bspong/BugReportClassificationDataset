Remove deprecated classes in jcr-commons
There are many classes in jackrabbit-jcr-commons that we ve replaced with better alternatives in spi-commons. I d like to clean things up by removing the deprecated versions from jcr-commons now that we re upgrading to Jackrabbit 2.0cleaned packages - org.apache.jackrabbit.util - org.apache.jackrabbit.util.name at rev. 781344 - org.apache.jackrabbit.value deprecated methods in ValueHelper.java at rev. 781347initial steps to clean package - org.apache.jackrabbit.name at rev. 781377 NOTE the NameValue and PathValue classes in jcr-commons still use the NameFormat.checkFormat and PathFormat.checkFormat. For this reason the corresponding classes haven t gone yet. However The Format classes in jcr-commons are not up-to-date and do not respect the name path extensions defined in JSR 283. This means that the Value implementations in jcr-commons are not compliant to JSR 283 and any implementation using them would fail to pass the TCK. My suggestion was to make the affected value implementations abstract or similar.... preferences i ll leave this issue open until we have that fixed.completed cleanup of package - org.apache.jackrabbit.name rev. 782925 by making ValueFactoryImpl just a dummy extension of an AbstractValueFactory that doesn t validate Name Path. Usage of ValueFactoryImpl within core and jcr2spi got replaced by a ValueFactory that properly covers the extensions made to Name and Path within the scope of jsr 283.
