Move privilege reader writer to spi-commons and use qualified names
the current privilege reader in jcr-commons uses a PrivilegeDefinition that is based on pure string rather than qualified names. suggest to move that to the spi-commons and use org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.Name for the privilege names.adjusting affected fix versions the custom privileges are not available to versions prio to 2.3 for me it doesn t make any difference. i m perfectly happy having it in spi-commons...
