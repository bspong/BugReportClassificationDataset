Various places do map lookups in loop instead of using entrySet iterator
Various places loop over a keyset iterator and do a map look up each time thru the loop I plan to convert these places to use an entryset iterator to avoid this.Committed revision 1084832The benefit of this change is improved iteration performance but are any of these cases where the performance boost is notable or even measurable on a macro level If not I would rather leave the code as is since the required Map.Entry syntax is rather verbose. AFAIUI Angela already reverted some of these changes. More generally unless there are obvious correctness performance or other clear benefits to an improvement like this the exact code patterns are often a matter of style and personal preference. In such cases I d leave it up to the original author to decide what the code should look like. ok sorry.
