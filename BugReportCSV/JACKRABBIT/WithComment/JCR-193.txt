MultiStatus response for PROPPATCH copied from JCR-175 
Rob Owen commented on JCR-175 doPropPatch in AbstractWebdavServlet still needs to send back a multistatus 207 response even in the successful case. I didn t see a way to collect the success failure status for each property but instead created a multistatus response and added a propstat SC OK for each of the properties in the setProperties and removeProperties. This allowed a WebDAV client which expected a multistatus response from PROPPATCH to work correctly with jcr-server. In the more general case the actual property status code will need to be used .Done. The method that sets and removes properties now returns a multistatus response object which contains the individiual property states. In addition modifyed the PROPPATCH so it now always returns a multistatus response even if the resource is locked as it is required by the RFC as far as i understood . NOTE with later change the nonowner-modify PROPATCH test of litmus 0.10.3 runs into an known bug. If we experience problem with clients as will i will remove the code that catches the DavExceptions and packs them into the mulitstatus see also note in the code .hi brian by end of this week or latest beginning next week . kind regards angela
