Redesign NodeInfo.getReferences 
The method returns an array of PropertyIds. When there are lots of references this may become an problem. As with any other return value that potentially is large we should return an iterator. I suggest to redesign the handling of references in line with recent discussions how child infos are handled. - A NodeInfo implementation must either return the complete list of PropertyIds or null if it does not want to return the PropertyIds at that time. - Introduce a new method Iterator PropertyId RepositoryService.getReferences SessionInfo NodeId This has the following advantages - loading of references can be delayed until it is really needed - large collections of references can be streamed through the SPIi would be in favor of that improvement.fixed together with JCR 2.0 reference features that includes - only obtain references that match a specified name - obtain weak references added method to RepositoryService as suggested by marcel but extended params. due to the additional functionality and since jcr2spi now only and always calls the repositoryservice method i decided to deprecate NodeInfo.getReferences instead of changing its semantics.... or should we simply remove it for 2.0
