Inheritance semantics especially with multiple inheritance are non-trivial at best and up to a certain degree arbitrary. Jackrabbit therefore in compliance with the spec doesn t support inheritance of node type attributes such as orderable. p               subsection           section           section name Node Type Definition I ve included an in-line patch above. Hope this helps.fixed in svn r617504 as suggested. thanks james
