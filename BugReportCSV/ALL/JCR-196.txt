jcr like does not scale well on large value ranges
There are two major issues with the current WildcardQuery implementation 1 A wildcard expression is restricted to match at most 1024 terms otherwise a TooManyClauses exception is thrown. Similar to the RangeQuery issue JCR-111 2 The enumeration over the terms that match the wildcard pattern is slowWildcardQuery is now much faster and also works with patterns that match a large range of terms e.g. a . - The regexp pattern matcher is reused for term compare operations. - Resolving document id s is done on an unpositioned TermDocs using seek instead of acquireing an instance for every term that matches. Implemented in revision 239404
