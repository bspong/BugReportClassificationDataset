OracleFileSystem uses getClass .getResourceAsStream to load schema file
org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.db.OracleFileSystem loads the schema via getClass .getResourceAsStream ... . This makes it impossible to extend the class without either copying the schema ddl file or overwriting checkSchema ... as the schema file is not accessible. The solution is to use OracleFilesystem.class.getResourceAsStream ... . See JCR-595 which fixed this already for org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.db.DatabasePersistenceManager.Patch for OracleFileSystemthanks for the patch fixed as suggested and applied same change to DatabaseFileSystem BundleDbPersistenceManager as well. fixed in svn r542831.Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 544305.
