avoid converting property values to strings
QValues currently can not expose properties of types LONG and DOUBLE in a parsed format. Thus setting retrieving properties of these types requires roundtripping through Strings which we should avoid. Proposal 1 Add long getLong and double getDouble to QValue. 2 Add matching create methods to QValueFactory. 3 Take advantage of the new methods in JCR2SPI for instance by allowing it s own Value implementation to internally just hold the QValue. Resolved with revision 587899.Change breaks JDK1.4 compliance. Resolved with revision 588723.
