Make WildcardTermEnum difference non-final
The method WildcardTermEnum difference is declared final. I found it very useful to subclass WildcardTermEnum to implement different scoring for exact vs. partial matches. The change is rather trivial attached but I guess it could make life easier for a couple of users. I attached two patches one which contains the single change to make difference non-final WildcardTermEnum.patch one which does also contain some minor cleanup of WildcardTermEnum. I removed unnecessary member initialization and made those final. WildcardTermEnum cleanup.patch Thanks simon I like the cleanup patch but I think we should not remove close Even though it s basically a no-op removing it breaks back-compat. Technically changing the members to final is also a break to back-compat but I think it s acceptable because WildcardTermEnum basically requires that these are final ie you can t up and change say pre after creation because the enum has already been set . I created a new patch containing the close method. I 100 believe you about your comment but I have a hard time to understand why it breaks back-compat. Could you give me a quick explanation please I might miss something. Thanks Simon I created a new patch containing the close method. Woops sorry I was wrong removing close is fine since super.close is still there and since we will no longer assign nulls to the members. I see. I could not thing of anything which would break the backwards compat. when removing the close method. The only thing I could have thought of was some convention I did not know about. So I assume the WildcardTermEnum cleanup.patch is fine. simon Thanks Simon
