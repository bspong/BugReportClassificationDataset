Upgrade to PDFBox 0.7.3
while trying to upload a PDF document which I can view fine with Acrobat Reader once it is loaded I get the following exception 01.05.2008 12 24 44 WARN PdfTextExtractor Failed to extract PDF text content PdfTextExtractor.java line 91 java.io.IOException Error Expected an integer type actual EOF         at org.pdfbox.pdfparser.BaseParser.readInt BaseParser.java 1159         at org.pdfbox.pdfparser.PDFParser.parseObject PDFParser.java 349         at org.pdfbox.pdfparser.PDFParser.parse PDFParser.java 132         at org.apache.jackrabbit.extractor.PdfTextExtractor.extractText PdfTextExtractor.java 69         at org.apache.jackrabbit.extractor.CompositeTextExtractor.extractText CompositeTextExtractor.java 90         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.JackrabbitTextExtractor.extractText JackrabbitTextExtractor.java 195         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.NodeIndexer.addBinaryValue NodeIndexer.java 393  .... I replaced the version of pdfbox 0.6.4 that is bundled with the jackrabbit war file with a more recent version 0.7.3 and fontbox 01. and it worked fine. The bundled versions should be upgraded. On the other hand this software appears to be inactive. Probably a different package should be selected in the long run but for now a simple upgrade will do the trick.Classifying this as an improvement as the bug is in PDFBox and not in Jackrabbit. The Jackrabbit improvement would be the upgrade to PDFBox 0.7.3. PS. PDFBox is currently incubating to become an Apache project so there s still life there.Upgraded the dependency in revision 661756. I explicitly excluded the transitive Bouncy Castle dependencies that would have forced us to deal with the crypto export stuff http www.apache.org dev crypto.html .
