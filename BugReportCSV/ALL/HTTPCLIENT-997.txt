cache module should handle out-of-order validations properly and unconditionally refresh
There is a protocol recommendation that when we attempt to revalidate a cache entry but we receive a response that has a Date header that s actually older than that of our current entry we SHOULD revalidate again unconditionally with either max-age 0 or no-cache since some upstream cache would appear to be out-of-date . http www.w3.org Protocols rfc2616 rfc2616-sec13.html sec13.2.6 The attached patch addresses this issue. In addition there were a couple of bugs that were fixed 1. When we get a potentially cacheable response outside of the validation path we likewise MUST check for out-of-order Date headers and not replace existing entries with older-dated ones. 2. Client requests with no-cache or no-store were causing invalidation of existing cache entries which is not actually required by the protocol. This patch is contributed to the ASF with the permission of my employer. Patch checked in. Oleg
