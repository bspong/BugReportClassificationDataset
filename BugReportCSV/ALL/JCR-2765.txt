JCR-SQL2 no count when WHERE clause is provided
whenever you provide a where-clause to a sql2 select jcr jackrabbit does not provide the hit count. E.g.    select from nt unstructured    order by jcr score returns the hit count query.execute .getRows .getSize whereas   select from nt unstructured   where entity customer   order by jcr score doesn t. This is not a blocker - maybe for your requirements but not for Jackrabbit. A blocker would be that jackrabbit does not start no nodes properties could be read etc. Since getSize can return -1 by definition and the order by trick to force getSize have the hit count returned is just a trick this is actually an improvement. Manually counting through the iterator is the way to go without the trick.I agree that this is not a Blocker but manually counting through an iterator just to get the count is not really an option fixed by https issues.apache.org jira browse JCR-2715
