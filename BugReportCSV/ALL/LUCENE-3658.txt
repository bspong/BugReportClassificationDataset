NRTCachingDir has invalid asserts if same file name is written twice 
Normally Lucene is write-once except for segments.gen file which NRTCachingDir never caches but in some tests TestDoc TestCrash we can write the same file more than once. I don t think NRTCachingDir should have these asserts and I think on createOutput it should remove any old file if present. I also found fixed a possible concurrency issue if more than one thread syncs at the same time IndexWriter doesn t ever do this today but it has in the past . Patch. I think it s ready... thanks for looking at these 2 tests now you see why I bailed on them 1 to commit
