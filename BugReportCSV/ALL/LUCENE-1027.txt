contrib benchmark config does not play nice with doubles with the flush.by.ram value
In the o.a.l.benchmark.byTask.utils.Config.java file the nextRound and various other methods do not handle doubles in the round property configuration syntax. To replicate this copy the micro-standard.alg and replace merge.factor mrg 10 100 10 100 max.buffered buf 10 10 100 100 with ram.flush.mb ram 32 40 48 56 and you will get various ClassCastExceptions in Config one in newRound and when that is fixed in getColsValuesForValsByRound. The fix seems to be to just to mirror the handling of int . The fix seems relatively minor. Patch shortly and will plan to commit tomorrow evening. Patch with fix and an alg file that mirrors micro-standard but flushes by RAM. Woops I caused this when I added double as a parameter type in Config. Thanks Hoss. The patch looks good Woops make that Thanks Grant . It s too early Committed.
