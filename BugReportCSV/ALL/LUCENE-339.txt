date encoding limitation removing
currently there is some limitation to date encoding in lucene. I think it s because dates should preserve lexicografical ordering i.e. if one date precedes another date then encoded values should keep same ordering. I know that it can be difficult to integrate it into existing version but there is way to remove this limitation. Date milliseconds can be encoded as unsigned values with prefix that indicates positive or negative value. In more details I used hex encoding and prefix ‘p’ and ‘n’ for positive and negative values. I got following results Value -10000 is encoded with nffffffffffffd8f0 -100 - nffffffffffffff9c 0 - p0000000000000000 100 - p0000000000000064 10000 - p0000000000002710 This preserves ordering between values and theirs encoding. Also hex encoding can be replaced with Character.MAX RADIX encoding. Part of code that do this work final static char digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z char prefix if time 0 prefix p else prefix n char chars new char DATE LEN 1 int index DATE LEN while time 0 int b int time 0x0F chars index digits b time time 4 while index 0 chars index 0 chars 0 prefix return new String chars I assume by some limitation you refer to the fact that no dates before 1970 can be used right This has been solved in CVS although in a different way than you suggested . So I ll close this bug feel free to re-open it if there s more than this no dates before 1970 issue.
