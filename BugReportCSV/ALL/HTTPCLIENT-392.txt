Provide additional test coverage for HTTP and HTTPS over proxy
HTTP and HTTPS over proxy test coverage is still insufficientWe also could use some proxy authentication tests.Mike Odi I have made some heavy modifications to the SimpleHttpServer and SimpleProxy code in order to enable connections keep-alive support. Please let me know if you agree with everything I have done to the Odi s original code SSL tunneling is next on my list OlegOk. Finally. I have just committed the SSL support for HttpSimpleServer and a SSL tunneling decorator for the proxy test cases. I believe now the proxy test suite is feature complete and quite comprehensive.
