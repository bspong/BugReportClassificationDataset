WorkspaceConfig.init throws NullPointerException if Search configuration is missing
When the search configuration is missing from the repository.xml configuration the WorkspaceConfig.sc field is null and consequently the WorkspaceConfig.init method throws a NullPointerException. This is by itself a bug especially since missing search configuration is perfectly ok resulting in Jackrabbit not building the search index which is - believe it or - what really want . On that matter since the configuration file structure seems to be implied by the configuration framework but the DTD is inlined into the configuration file the configuration framework should act very gracefully to missing or wrong or unexpected configuration elements. Thus for example if the file system configuration WorkspaceConfig.fsc would be missing the WorkspaceConfig should probably hint at this point and not throw a NullPointerException without further explanations of course throwing anything at all is still better than going wild .Fixed in revision 157916. Thanks for reporting the issue The configuration parser attempts to throw a ConfigurationException whenever the configuration file does not match the DTD requirements. In this case however the missing searchConfig element is perfectly OK and should be handled accordingly. As reported the problem was in the WorkspaceConfig.init method that did not expect the SearchConfig to be null even when the ConfigurationParser.parseSearchConfig method explicitly returns null for a missing search configuration.
