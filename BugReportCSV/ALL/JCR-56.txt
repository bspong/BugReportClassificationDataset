allow case insensitive searches
would be nice to be able to search specific properties like a fulltext search e.g. with an ignore-case flag so you could find a subset of the results of   select from nt base where contains bla using something like   select from nt base where jcr bla like bla currently the value must contain bla exactly as it is to be found by the second query i suggest to extend the contains function with an additional argument for the property to search in e.g.   select from nt base where contains bla jcr bla this could then also easily be used in XPath. Extended syntax of XPath jcrfn contains and SQL contains to accept a second argument. jcrfn contains accepts a property name or a . whereas the SQL contains function accepts a property name or a . Examples jcrfn contains . foo SELECT FROM nt base WHERE CONTAINS foo  - returns all nodes that have a property that contains foo jcrfn contains title foo SELECT FROM nt base WHERE CONTAINS title foo  - returns all nodes that contain the word foo in a title property Jackrabbit currently still support the one argument version of the contains function. But support will probably be removed with the next version 0.16.4 of the JCR spec. SVN revision 160047
