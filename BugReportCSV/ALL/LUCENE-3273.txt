Convert Lucene Core tests over to a simple MockQueryParser
Most tests use Lucene Core s QueryParser for convenience. We want to consolidate it into a QP module which we can t have as a dependency. We should add a simple MockQueryParser which does String.split on the query string analyzers the terms and builds a BooleanQuery if necessary. Any more complex Queries such as phrases should be done programmatically. Patch with first shot at this. MockQueryParser is introduced. It handles a very simple syntax consisting of boolean operators and can identify Wildcard queries. Cannot handle complex BooleanQuerys boosts or PhraseQuerys. QueryBuilderHelper is introduced which provides some utilities methods for building queries currently just to create a TermQuery with a boost BooleanQueryBuilder and PhraseQueryBuilder are introduced to ease the process of programmatically creating complex BooleanQuerys and PhraseQuerys. All core Lucene tests apart from those in the queryparser package have been moved away from relying on QueryParser. In extremely trivial situations TermQuerys are now directly instantiated. In others the MockQueryParser is used. In complex scenarios the Builder classes are used to programmatically create the queries. Some tests have been split up and moved around. Tests that did both parsing assertions and search assertions have been split so the parsing assertions go into TestQueryParser since they are testing the QPs supported language . Next step is to visit the contrib tests and clear those out too so we can prevent any back dependencies on the queryparser module. I m in favor of eliminating the QueryParser dependency but i feel like this approach of adding things like BooleanQueryBuilder leads us down the road towards tests that are so verbose in query construction it will draw attention away from the important parts of the test Ð doing something with those queres. a while back when i wrote TestExplanations i added a bunch of convenience methods for constructing esoteric queries that i couldn t get cleanly from the QueryParser mainly spans Ð perhaps we should move towards generalizing that approach ... either in a Utility class where they can be staticly imported or into LuceneTestCase These days we could even use vargs for things like Phrase Boolean and SpanNear queries we weren t using Java5 when i wrote the existing ones That way instead of things like this... PhraseQuery q new PhraseQuery Query this hi this is a test is q.add new Term field hi 1 q.add new Term field test 5 assertEquals field hi test q.toString ...we could have ... Query q phraseQ field null hi null null null test assertEquals field hi test q.toString And instead of this... public void testDMQ8 throws Exception DisjunctionMaxQuery q new DisjunctionMaxQuery 0.5f q.add new BooleanQueryBuilder FIELD .addTermQuery yy .addQuery QueryBuilderHelper.newTermQuery FIELD w5 100 .get q.add QueryBuilderHelper.newTermQuery FIELD xx 100000 qtest q new int 0 2 3 ...we could have... public void testDMQ8 throws Exception DisjunctionMaxQuery q new DisjunctionMaxQuery 0.5f q.add booleanQ opt termQ FIELD yy opt termQ FIELD w5 100 q.add termQ FIELD xx 100000 qtest q new int 0 2 3 With all due respect hoss i d rather have the former than the latter. The latter reminds me of solr tests which use this approach I find them extremely painful to read. to each his own i guess. I just think it makes sense for utilities that do the banal stuff that s not central to the actually methods being tested should be as short as possible and get the hell out of the way Ð the code you actually want to test should be verbose and catch your eye. the difference here is that I think in general the tests should use look like the API. this makes them readable for people e.g. new contributors who already know lucene s API to understand what the tests do. For example in the lucene tests we added various randomization but we tried to make it look just like the API except deleting a space new IndexWriterConfig - newIndexWriterConfig new Directory - newDirectory new Field - newField ... in some of these tests I think its actually way more clear to explicitly build the BQs and not use any builders or parsers especially TestBoolean2 for example. I fear sometimes people get caught up on more lines of code bad. I think this is wrong sometimes more lines of code is good. parsers builder apis and helper methods might reduce the number of lines of code but they add additional layers and obfuscation that makes this a terrible tradeoff. I would also prefer to keep tests very straightforward even if that makes them more verbose. Ie just use the Lucene core API and if the core API is insufficient we should improve it. I don t think we should be adding very much special test-only APIs. In fact why even add a builder here for BQ Can t we just make the BQ and add the clauses In general I m not a fan of builder APIs... I think they are over-applied these days hammer and I don t think we need it here for our tests. here s my example TestBoolean2. in my opinion building the queries like this makes the test much more readable. it adds 48 lines and deletes 29 lines of code... I think adding these 19 lines of code to this 343 line test case is worth every penny because its much easier to see what any given test does e.g. just glance real quick at testQueries06 and you see its a BQ with one MUST and two MUST NOTS no parsing by the brain required.

In defence of builders its a great design pattern and I don t agree that its over-applied. With all that said I ll move away from them. New patch new ideas. I ve moved away from introducing anything new and have converted all the core tests over to instantiating Queries programmatically. No builders helpers are used. Everything compiles and passes again. Thanks Chris Patch looks great. Committed revision 1143231.
