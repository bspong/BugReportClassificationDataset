remove deprecated classes from spatial
spatial has not been released so we can remove the deprecated classes removes the deprecated classes - there were two public fields declared of a deprecated type - they were not used so they are pulled in this patch. Spatial could really use some love - its not in the best shape for its debut - there is no good overview no package.html to explaining anything and extremely sparse javadoc. Its in less than great shape for users and maintenance I think. You can look at the tests for a little help though. But for someone that just even wants to know if they would want to use it... Spatial could really use some love I agree. There are also some spooky issues opened on it eg LUCENE-1781 LUCENE-1815. I think we should somehow call this out in the javadocs... at least declaring the whole package experimental for starters done and done whoops - I ve committed the issue but ill reopen till Mike s comments are addressed I ll take a crack at the javadocs... Patch to add warnings about newness of this package to the javadocs.
