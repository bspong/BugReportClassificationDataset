Performance improvement in OpenBitSetDISI.inPlaceAnd 
For those interested in OpenBitSet and DocIdSetIterator just have a look at the patch ant test-contrib passes. Once more with licence grant. Some more bits some less. The b patch should be faster than the previous one. Looks good Paul the int version of clear makes sense in this context given how many times it can be called. I ll commit LUCENE-1443b.patch shortly unless you have more changes coming. Thanks for taking a look Yonik I was about to invite you to do that. Maybe the duplication between the long and int version of clear could be refactored into a private method but I m not going to bother further my normal tolerance level for code duplication is at most 2 duplicates not too far from each other. Thanks Paul I just committed this and also set eol-style on OpenBitSet.java
