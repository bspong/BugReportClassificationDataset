Add Google Analytics to Jackrabbit web site
I d like to add Google Analytics to our web site to better track how the site is used and how much traffic we are generating. Currently the best stats we have are at http people.apache.org vgritsenko stats projects jackrabbit.html which is nice but not nearly as good as we could have.Google Analytics added in revision 612189 and will go to the live site later today before the 1.4 announcement.
