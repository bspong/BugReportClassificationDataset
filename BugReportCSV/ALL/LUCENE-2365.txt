Finding Newest Segment In Empty Index
While extending the index writer I discovered that its newestSegment method does not check to see if there are any segments before accessing the segment infos vector. Specifically if you call the IndexWriter newestSegment method on a brand-new index which is essentially empty then it throws an java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exception. The proposed fix is to return null if no segments exist as shown below Ñ lucene src java org apache lucene index IndexWriter.java revision 930788 lucene src java org apache lucene index IndexWriter.java working copy -4587 7 4587 7 utility routines for tests SegmentInfo newestSegment - return segmentInfos.info segmentInfos.size -1 return segmentInfos.size 0 segmentInfos.info segmentInfos.size -1 null The unit test case that expose this issue along with the proposed patch can be found in LUCENE-2365.patch. Thanks patch looks good I ll commit shortly Thanks Karthick reopening for possible 2.9.4 3.0.3 backport. Committed revision 1029013 to 3.0.x Committed revision 1029016 to 2.9.x
