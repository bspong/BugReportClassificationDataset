IndexWriter does not do the right thing when a Thread is interrupt d
Spinoff from here http www.nabble.com Deadlock-with-concurrent-merges-and-IndexWriter Lucene-2.4 to22714290.html When a Thread is interrupt d while inside Lucene there is a risk currently that it will cause a spinloop and starve BG merges from completing. Instead when possible we should allow interruption. But unfortunately for back-compat we will need to wrap the exception in an unchecked version. In 3.0 we can change that to simply throw InterruptedException. Attached patch. All tests pass including a new one that showed the deadlock. I also found fixed a case where IndexWriter would hang during close thinking a BG merge was still running when it wasn t if the InterruptedException arrived at the right time. I ll commit in a day or two. Thanks Jeremy.
