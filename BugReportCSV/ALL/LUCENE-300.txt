 PATCH Refactoring of SpanScorer
Refactored some common code in next and skipTo . Removed dependency on score value for next and skipTo . Passes all current tests at just about the same speed as the current version. Added minimal javadoc. Iirc there has been some discussion on the dependency of next and skipTo on the score value but I don t remember the conclusion. In case that dependency should stay in it can be adapted in the refactored code. Created an attachment id 13326 Refactored SpanScorer Created an attachment id 14115 SpanScorer.java refactored and corrected copyright This change has already made it to the trunk most likely via LUCENE 413.
