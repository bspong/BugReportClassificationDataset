Integrate MockBM25Similarity and MockLMSimilarity into the framework
Steps 1. Decide if MockLMSimilarity is needed at all we have LMDirichletSimilarity 2. Move the classes to the similarities package 3. Move the similarities package to src 4. Move all sims inc. Similarity to similarities 5. Make MockBM25Similarity a subclass of EasySimilarity Removed MockLMSimilarity and its provider. Renamed MockBM25Similarity and its provider to BM25... and moved them to the similarities package. All that s left is to decide whether they should be rebased on EasySimilarity or not. Apparently mv doesn t refactor the code. Who would have thought... Moved the similarities package to src only testing-related classes remain in test. Moved all sims to similarities. I decided agains step 5 at least for now so I propose we resolve this issue. Thanks David good thorough refactor here
