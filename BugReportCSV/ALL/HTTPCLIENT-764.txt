HttpClient javadocs need improving
.. patch coming.This is a small patch for improving some httpclient javadocs. I didn t do everything but focused mainly on the classes I knew and classes which were lacking class-level javadocs. Also included is a small change in the way the ClientPNames.CONNECTION MANAGER FACTORY parameter was used by DefaultHttpClient. I renamed that parameter to CONNECTION MANAGER FACTORY CLASS NAME since it s just the name of the class that is reflectively created and replaced the old one with setting of the actual instance of a ClientConnectionManagerFactory. This is important if the factory s constructor needed any dependencies it wanted to pass to instances of whatever ClientConnectionManager it wants to create.Fantastic Happily committed. Many thanks Sam OlegDone in trunk. Oleg
