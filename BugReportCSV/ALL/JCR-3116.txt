Cluster Node ID should be trimmed
If the cluster node ID is not configured in repository.xml it is read from the file cluster node.id instead. In case this file is edited by hand some editors e.g. vi insert a trailing newline character n . This leads to the cluster node ID to contain a blank character. While I don t expect this to cause any issues it is inconvenient for debugging and also introduces line-breaks in log files. I suggest to trim the cluster node ID so only non-blank characters are used.Trivial patch. Note that a null check is not needed since FileUtils.readFileToString is documented to never return null.Committed in the trunk only so far .
