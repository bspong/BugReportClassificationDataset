o.a.h.conn.scheme.PlainSocketFactory is not a true Singleton
The class org.apache.http.conn.scheme.PlainSocketFactory has a factory method getSocketFactory and clearly indicates in the Javadocs that it expects to be a Singleton however the presence of public constructors makes it quite possible that this is not the case. To protect the Singleton status of the class the constructors should be private or at the very least default package access. This will force access to the single instance through the factory method.Jonathan Actually there is no longer any reason why socket factories need to be implemented as singletons. This limitation of 3.x API is no longer relevant for 4.0. I updated the javadocs to not mention singleton anymore. Many thanks for reporting the problem. Oleg
