SSLSocketFactory.connectSocket possible NPE - or use of wrong variable 
SSLSocketFactory.connectSocket has a possible NPE at line 324             sock.connect remoteAddress connTimeout Or perhaps this should really be             sslsock.connect remoteAddress connTimeout Fixed. Sebastian please do not be shy to fix things that are obviously wrong. Cheers OlegI would have fixed it but was not 100 sure that it was a typo...
