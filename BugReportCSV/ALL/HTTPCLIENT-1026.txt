Properly close resources
Java has exceptions so resources must always be closed on a finally clauseYou may want first to commit a patch to remove whitespace at the end of the line and then apply this patch.Eduardo If you want this patch applied you should also change other examples to make them consistent. OlegI missed httpmime example. Any other example My bad. I did not look at the patch carefully enough. All examples seem there. I will review and apply the patch in the coming days. OlegEduardo Patches do not apply cleanly against the latest SVN trunk. Could you please create a new diff against the latest snapshot off the SVN trunk OlegPatch against trunkPatch checked in. Many thanks Eduardo Oleg
