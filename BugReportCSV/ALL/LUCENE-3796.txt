Disallow setBoost on StringField throw exception if boosts are set if norms are omitted
Occasionally users are confused why index-time boosts are not applied to their norms-omitted fields. This is because we silently discard the boost there is no reason for this The most absurd part in 4.0 you can make a StringField and call setBoost and nothing complains... more reasons to remove StringField totally in my opinion 1 to apply patch. This also effects NumericFields and any other norms-free field. updated patch also fixing tests and making the exception clearer including the fieldname . I think its ready to commit 1 1 heavy committing
