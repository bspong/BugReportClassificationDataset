yank SegmentReader.norm out of SegmentReader.java
While working on flex scoring branch and LUCENE-3012 I noticed it was difficult to navigate the norms handling in SegmentReader s code. I think we should yank this inner class out into a separate file as a start. 1 this code is scary and pulling it out is a great baby step. oops the last patch had an outdated hack for calling the silly SR.cloneBytes Committed revision 1125376 1125390 hopefully we can take some more steps here soon to make SR s norms handling less scary. Bulk closing for 3.2
