left nav of docs index.html in dist artifacts links to hudson for javadocs
When building the zip or tgz release artifacts the docs index.html file contained in that release the starter point for people to read documentation links API Docs to http lucene.zones.apache.org 8080 hudson job Lucene-Nightly javadoc instead of to . api index.html the local copy of the javadocs this relates to the initial migration to hudson for the nightly builds and a plan to copy the javadocs back to lucene.apache.org that wasn t considered urgent since it was just for transient nightly docs but a side affect is that the release documentation also links to hudson. even if we don t modify the nightly build process before the 2.2 release we should update the link in the left nav in the 2.2 release branch before building the final release. The link should be relative to . api index.html but . api should redirect to zones. You can add a redirect to http svn.apache.org repos asf lucene .htaccess then run svn up in www lucene.apache.org . There is an .htaccess in docs api already to zones so I guess we can just point the top level docs back to it. I will take care of it .
