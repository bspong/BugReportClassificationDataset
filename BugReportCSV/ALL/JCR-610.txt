Upgrade to Derby 10.2
Apache Derby 10.2 was released recently. The release contains a number of improvements including performance and requires no special upgrade procedures. I suggest we upgrade to Derby 10.2 along with Lucene 2.0 JCR-352 and Maven 2 JCR-332 .Upgraded jackrabbit-core to use Derby 10.2.1.6 in revision 485605. Passes all unit tests and seems to work fine with existing repositories so likely no manual upgrade steps are required. There are some improvements in the Derby 10.2 disk layout that are by default not enabled when using a database created with 10.1. To get full benefits in 10.2 one needs to include the upgrade true attribute in the JDBC connection string. I ll probably include a note about this in the Jackrabbit 1.2 release notes.
