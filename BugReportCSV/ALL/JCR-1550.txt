Remove ItemInfo.getName since it is redundant
I propose to remove the method getName from org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.ItemInfo since it is redundant. The name is always the last element of the path which is available via the getPath method.you are right... since it seems not to be used currently with jcr2spi nor with any of the implementations i am in favor of that change. concerns objections by anybody proposed patch for the trunk 1no objections. assuming lazy consensus. trunk completed at revision 651626 sandbox spi completed at revision 651627
