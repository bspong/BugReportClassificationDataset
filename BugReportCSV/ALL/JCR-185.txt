filter jcr properties in jcr-server
attached is a patch that implements jcr property filtering in jcr-server in the same way that nodes and resources are filtered. with the default filter configuration this has the effect of filtering jcr created jcr mixinTypes and jcr primaryType from nt folder and nt file nodes. this is likely the expected default behavior for most webdav servers - they want to return the normal dav properties live properties defined themselves and dead properties defined by clients but not jcr-internal properties which are for all intents and purposes implementation-specific.this patch also makes all of DavResourceImpl s private methods protected so that subclasses can use them. sorry that i didn t extract those changes from the patch - i figured they d be easy to spot and difficult to pull from the patch and get the remaining line numbers right.DavResourceImpl should also honor the ResourceFilter when setting and removing properties.as you may have noticed there is a todo in the DavResourceImpl that addresses the issue of filtering properties. however i intended to create a ResourceFilter... with that change it would turn into an ItemFilter. i will think about it. regards angelayup i did notice the todo. i needed to implement PROPPATCH property filtering so i thought i d submit my changes to give you something to start with. i m not married to the implementation - i just did what was easiest for me knowing that you d probably revise it later. this patch implements property filtering against the current HEAD revision without the extra noise of the previous patch which is now removed . angela your previous comment still stands so i d like to hear your current thoughts on the issue. whoops mistakenly deleted the patch i just uploaded oh yes... this one is still open... forgot about it sorry. yes why not. i will apply the changes but also rename the filter class. regards angela cheer will be fixed as follows - rename ResourceFilter - ItemFilter - rename check methods isFilteredItem instead of isFilteredResource - rename default implementation - DavResourceImpl     remove todo for props     rename isFilteredNode to isFilteredItem     no need for extra method checking filtering status of properties. - change config.xml and adjust description.rev. 355130
