ParallelMultiSearcher should shut down thread pool on close
ParallelMultiSearcher does not shut down its internal thread pool on close. As a result programs that create multiple instances of this class over their lifetime end up leaking threads. Simple fix. Current implementation of ParallelMultiSearcher uses a cached thread pool with a core size of 0 and a keep alive time of 60 seconds. This will not leak any threads but closing it is a good idea anyway. I will move this to minor and I don t think its a bug either but good that you found it Thanks I ll commit this soon - Thanks Committed revision 906744 Thanks Martin reopening for possible 2.9.4 3.0.3 backport. 2.9 uses no executors so only 3.0.3 This was already backported with LUCENE-2494.
