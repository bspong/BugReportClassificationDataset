tm-extractors.jar blocks usage of newer poi versions
The used tm-extractors-0.4.jar http repo1.maven.org maven2 org textmining tm-extractors includes various classes from poi as well as poi-2.5.1 is referenced as dependency in the pom.xml. It s seems not possible to use a newer version of poi e.g. poi-3.0.1-FINAL together with tm-extractors and so jackrabbit . A solution could be using functions of newer poi versions I m not sure if they are only in scratchpad yet or use a fixed version of tm-extractors.jar which doesn t inlude the poi classes.At some point Jackrabbit 1.5 I think we should switch to using Apache Tika http incubator.apache.org tika instead of our custom text extractors. Meanwhile it would be nice to fix this but without a more recent tm-extractors dependency or some effort in replacing the use of tm-extractors with direct POI calls there s not much we can do. So it would be great if someone wants to submit a patch for this improvement. Otherwise this will get fixed once we switch to Apache Tika.Replaced tm-extractors with poi-scratchpad and upgraded to poi 3.0.1-FINAL. svn revision 617385
