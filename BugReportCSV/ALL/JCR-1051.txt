MatchAllScorer calculateDocFilter bug
In MatchAllScorer.calculateDocFilter When you have just two nodes with different properties like myprop and myprop2 and you have an xpath String xpath myprop you get both nodes back to be precise you ll get every node that has a property that startswith myprop You can reproduce it by changing the SimpleQueryTest.testIsNotNull a little Change bar.setProperty text the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. to bar.setProperty mytextwhichstartswithmytext the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Now the test with xpath jcr primaryType nt unstructured and mytext fails because 2 results. I did test for the trunk and tag 1.3.1 and both have the same problem. I have attached MatchAllScorer.java.patch in this mail or should I create a JIRA issue for this Furthermore I would like to discuss a different implementation for the MatchAllScorer because IMHO the current calculateDocFilter becomes slow pretty fast see bottom email the code part i am referring to if you have 100.000 docs with mytext property and you query mytext the loop below is executed at least 100.000 times . I think it might be out of scope for the user-list or is the user-list the place to discuss something like this TermEnum terms reader.terms new Term FieldNames.PROPERTIES field         try             TermDocs docs reader.termDocs             try                 while terms.term null                          terms.term .field FieldNames.PROPERTIES                          terms.term .text .startsWith field                     docs.seek terms                     while docs.next                         docFilter.set docs.doc                                          terms.next                               finally                 docs.close                       finally             terms.close          fixPatch looks good. If no one objects I will commit the patch together with the proposed addition to the testcase.Patch applied in revision 563673. Thanks Ard Please post a mail to the developers list to discuss optimization of MatchAllScorer. I m very interested in your suggestions.We should avoid creating the named value in the while loop.Fixed in revision 565316Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 577816.
