Privilege content representation should be of property type NAME
the content representation of jcr privileges should reflect that fact that privilege names changed from simple string to JCR name.changed property definition in built-in nodetypes and adjusted the corresponding createValue setProperty calls to user PropertyType.NAME.Changing this to an improvement issue as the original implementation was in line with previous spec text and I don t think we should merge this to 1.5 . BTW do you think this should be noted in the 1.6 release notes for people who are already trying out the new security code I m not sure how big an impact the changed property type will cause. I don t think we should merge this to 1.5 no rather not. BTW do you think this should be noted in the 1.6 release notes for people who are already trying out the new security code I m not sure how big an impact the changed property type will cause. big. that s why i scheduled it for 2.0.0. but after all the 283 implementation is still work in progress and Issue JCR-1588 has not been closed up to now. unless the spec is finalized there may be any kind of changes that break backwards compability. listing in in the release notes may still be a good idea.
