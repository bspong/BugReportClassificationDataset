DefaultProtectedPropertyImporter masks several fields from parent causing potential derived classes to not perform correctly
The fields session resolver and referenceTracker are duplicated in DefaultProtectedPropertyImporter from DefaultProtectedItemImporter and thus future derived classes will not function correctly if they attempt to use those fields as they will be null. I Plan to remove them from DefaultProtectedPropertyImporterCommitted revision 1084480
