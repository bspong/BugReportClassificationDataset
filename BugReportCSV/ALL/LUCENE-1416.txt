Ant contrib test can fail if there is a space in path to lucene project
A couple contrib ant tests get the path to test files through a URL object and so the path is URL encoded. Normally fine but if you have a space in your path svn stuff lucene contrib ant then it will have 20 for the space and at least on my Ubuntu system the test will fail with filenotfound. This patch simply replaces all 20 with . Not sure if we want need to take it any further. Is there a more generic function that can un-escape a URL-encoded string Space 20 seems like the most common problem but other characters are escaped in URLs too. Yeah thats why I mention we might want to take it further. Just wasn t sure if another char was actually a problem. We can use URLDecoder to hit everything though right I ll put up a new patch when I get a chance. Patch using URLDecoder Thank Mark I just committed this
