porting of ProxyClient from 3.1 to 4.x API
With 3.1 version of HttpClient it was possible to establish a tunneled connection to a generic non http server through an authenticated proxy but since 3.1 version does not support NTLMv2 and Kerberos authentication that are supported in 4.x version it is very useful to port the features provided by ProxyClient to 4.x API.Implemented in SVN trunk.
