Prevent persistence of faulty back-references
The SharedItemStateManager updates reference data. Sometimes the back-references to reference properties are not updated correctly with the result that nodes cannot removed anymore. The attached patch contains JUnit test cases and a possible solution.The patch works in such a way that reference properties with the same id which are added in two sessions at the same time do not collide i.e. the last save wins and no exception is thrown . This is the same behavior as before except for that the externally added references are now first removed which keeps the back-reference data in good shape. The alternative is to throw an ItemStateException. I also tried that but then a versioning related test failed the RestoreAndCheckoutTest . 1 looks good just one minor issue with the patch. it introduces a svn keyword property on the test class. please remove it before committing the patch.Marcel thanks for your comment. I ll commit the patch shortly without the svn props.Committed patch in revision 789245. Merged to the 1.x branch in revision 791827.Merged to the 1.5 branch in revision 794288.
