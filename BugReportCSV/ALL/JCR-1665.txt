In JCAConnectionRequestInfo equals and hashCode implementations are inconsistent
JCAConnectionRequestInfo behaves differently in its equals and hashCode methods. The former is aware about SimpleCredentials structure so two instances of JCAConnectionRequestInfo were supplied SimpleCredentials instances with same userID password and attributes they are considered equal. But JCAConnectionRequestInfo.hashCode just delegates to SimpleCredentials.hashCode which is same as Object s method. This breaks session pooling.Attaching a patch which contains a test demonstrating a problem and a quick fix.Thanks for the patch Applied in rev. 779032Merged to the 1.x branch in revision 789706.
