Caching in QueryHandler does not scale well
Caching in class CachingIndexReader uses too much memory. It uses around 500 bytes per node and does not use any strategy to limit the cache. This improvement covers two goals - lower per-node memory cost for caching - implement a caching strategy using e.g LRU algorithmCaching is now less memory consuming. - Caching the hierarchy relation between indexed nodes needs approximately 25 bytes per node. - UUID to lucene document number mapping is cached with a LRU algorithm. The default cache size is set to 1000 entries. Implemented in svn revision 234492
