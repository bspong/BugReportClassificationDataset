Upgrade to Tika 1.0
Tika 1.0 was released today and has many improvements over the earlier 0.10 release. We should upgrade.please check the transitive dependencies. IMO we should strip all exotic and rarely used dependencies.Upgraded to 1.0 and adjusted the exclusion rules form JCR-2885 accordingly. With these exclusions we still keep the following dependencies     PDF pdfbox fontbox jempbox bcmail bcprov     MS Office poi poi-ooxml poi-ooxml-schemas poi-scratchpad commons-codec xmlbeans dom4j geronimo-stax-api     HTML tagsoup Basic formats like plain text XML and RTF plus rudimentary support for OpenOffice are handled with the standard Java class library.
