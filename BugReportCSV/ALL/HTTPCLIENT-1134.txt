BasicResponseHandler Javadoc Needs Clarification
The class-level javadoc for BasicResponseHandler indicates that it reads the response body before throwing an Exception for responses with status code 300 which is not the case.Attached a diff with proposed documentation changes.You know what There is actually no good reason for BasicResponseHandler to not consume response content in case of an unsuccessful result status code 300 . The change will have no effect on existing application code will make javadocs consistent with the behavior of the handler and this should make everyone happy. Oleg
