Poor performance in range queries using dates
I am evaluating migrating from 1.5 to 1.6. I created several test cases that prove the query performance of 1.6 is the same or better than 1.5. That is until I add a date property into my query. The repository has 400 000 nodes. Each node as several string based properties property property2 ... and a date based property datestart . Every node has a relatively unique datestart and the total date range spans 6 years. In my tests my base query is element my namespace property value order by datestart descending The time to run this query in 1.5 and 1.6 is 1.5 1.5 seconds 1.6 1.5 seconds If I add a date property element my namespace property value and datestart xs dateTime 2009-09-24T11 53 23.293-05 00 order by datestart descending the results are 1.5 1.5 seconds 1.6 3.5 seconds I have isolated the slow down to the implementation of SortedLuceneQueryHits. SortedLuceneQueryHits is not present in 1.5. I have run versions of the test where the query is run 20 times simultaneously and a different time where the query is run 20 times sequentially. In both tests I do see evidence that caching is taking place but it provides only very minor performance gains. Also running the 1.6 query multiple times does not decrease the query time dramatically. http www.nabble.com Date-Property-Performance-in-1.6-td25704607.htmlIt turns out the slowdown is not related to SortedLuceneQueryHits. With Jackrabbit 1.6 we also switched to Lucene 2.4.1 and one special handling in our RangeQuery implementation become obsolete 0 . It seems the Lucene replacement is a bit slower than what we previously had. I ll revert the changed to this class. Please also note that you can reduce the query time further when you set a limit on the number of results. However the method Query.setLimit is only available in JCR 2.0. For 1.6 you d have to cast the query to QueryImpl. 0 http svn.apache.org viewvc jackrabbit trunk jackrabbit-core src main java org apache jackrabbit core query lucene RangeQuery.java r1 752064 r2 756444Fixed in revision 829823Oops that commit went to the 1.6 branch but should have gone to trunk. Reverted previous commit in revision 830246 and committed the changed to trunk in revision 830238
