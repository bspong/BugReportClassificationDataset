Node.setProperty String ... implementation not according to the specification
to illustrate the issue assume the following property definition name someText type String non-mandatory non-autocreate the following call would throw a ConstraintViolationException if the property doesn t exist yet node.setProperty someText 12345 the rules used to find an applicable definition in this case are too strict.fixed in svn r387211Should I merge this with 1.0 How high is the chance of unexpected regressions caused by r387211 i targeted 1.0 as this is imo a major bug causing jsr170 compliancy issues. i tested the fix and found no problems whatsoever. however it s a relatively small but non-trivial change. judging the risk of unexpected regressions is very difficult. maybe we should target 1.0.1 instead.OK thanks. I ll merge it in 1.0 on the basis of JSR 170 compliancy. If it does cause a problem then we can always release a fix in 1.0.1. I d rather err with a bug in 1.0 than an API compliancy issue especially as the change seems to work just fine for me as well. Merged to 1.0 in revision 387311.
