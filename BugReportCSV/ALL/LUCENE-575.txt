SpellChecker min score is increased by time
The minimum score an instance variable is modified in a search. That is wrong since it makes it 1. thread unsafe and 2. not working. Lucky enought it is only used from the one and same method call so I simply compied the instance variable to a local method variable. float min this.min I would have to say this is for 2.0 as the SpellCheck does not work without it in most cases. This is just another push to get the patch committed. I just commited this. Thanks Karl Closing all issues that were resolved for 2.1.
