jcr mixinTypes property inconsitent if addMixin throws exception
If Node.addMixin throws an exception that was not due to validation checks but rather internal the jcr mixinTypes still contains the newly added nodetype. a subsequent call to Item.save will store that property. The effective nodetype is not affected though.fixed in NodeImpl.addMixin String
