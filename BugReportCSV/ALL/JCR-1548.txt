Several bugs in last SVN commit
Just a few bugs in the last SVN commit but since I work with it i thought useful to mention them 1 org.apache.jackrabbit.ocm.reflection.ReflectionUtils should handle Set just add it in defaultImplementation 2 in org.apache.jackrabbit.ocm.manager.collectionconverter.ManageableObjectsUtil.getManageableObjects correct defaultImplementation test          if defaultImplementation null                   throw new JcrMappingException No default implementation for the interface manageableObjectsClass Thank you and keep up the good work Sincerely yours StephaneAs a general comment if a commit is in error it s typically better to reopen the original issue and commit that the fix is incomplete. If the problem is not really related to the original issue i.e. a regression then a separate issue is OK. But note that it would be better to file specific issues for each encountered problem rather than a generic several bugs issue. Anyway thanks for reporting this and suggesting fixes I m OK to keep this issue as is.Fixed. Thanks. Let me know if something is wrong.There s still a throw missing on line 69 in org.apache.jackrabbit.ocm.manager.collectionconverter.ManageableObjectsUtil.getManageableObjects...
