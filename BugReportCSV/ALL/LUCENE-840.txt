contrib benchmark unit tests
The need came up in this thread http www.mail-archive.com java-dev lucene.apache.org msg09260.html We might want to start thinking about Unit Tests... Seems kind of weird to have tests for tests but this is becoming sufficiently complex that it should have some tests. Attached 840-benchmark-tests.patch adds unit tests. No bugs exposed but it would be useful for future changes. The patch code is relative to contrib benchmark of current trunk but it is based on the pending changes of 837 and in fact contains these changes so it can be tried now. Once 837 is committed I will update this patch. I had to modify a little the Benchmark class API so that it is easy to run a benchmark from a String using StringReader rather than from a file . Added two tests only - a parse one that verifies that tasks are parsed to what they should and a logic one that verifies that the test side effects index creation docs adding search being called etc. is as expected. I think it should be fairly easy now to add further tests to the logic one should that be needed. To use it cd to contrib benchmark apply patch ant test Patch updated to apply cleanly on current code. Should be applied from trunk because it also modifies common-build.xml to allow the test to scan for PerfTask classes and attempt to test their parsing in case their names were not added to TestPerfTasksParse. If no comments will commit this pretty soon. Just commited this. Note tests added are quite basic however structure is now there for adding more.
