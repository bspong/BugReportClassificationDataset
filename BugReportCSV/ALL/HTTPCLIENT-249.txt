please log allocation of new connections to support debugging testing
I d like to suggest that the MultiThreaded connection manager emit a trace-level log when it allocates a new HttpConnection to support debugging and testing. I added one while working on my integration in Apache Axis see org.apache.axis.transport.http.CommonsHTTPSender and figured this would be of general use. I ll attach a patch with the oh-so-minor addition after submitting this enhancement request.Created an attachment id 7439 patch that introduces new trace level logging call in multithreaded mgr Mike This suggestion does make sense to me. As connection pooling is almost exclusively your department do you mind taking a look at the patch and checking it in OlegWorks for me. I think DEBUG might be more appropriate in this case than TRACE. Thoughts MikeI agree. I think DEBUG priority is more appropriate in this case OlegI will apply the patch with a few additions to HEAD and 2.0 when I get home tonight. Mikethanks very much it s appreciated Patch applied. Enjoy. Mike
