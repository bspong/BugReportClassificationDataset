replace text from an online collection used in few test cases with text that is surely 100 free.
Text from an online firstaid collection firstaid . ie . eu . org is used as arbitrary text for test documents creation in o.a.l.analysis.Analyzer.FunctionTestSetup.DOC TEXT LINES o.a.l.benchmark.byTask.feeds.SimpleDocMaker.DOC TEXT I once got this text from Project Gutenberg and was sure that it is free. But now the referred Web site does not seem to respond and I can no more find that firstaid eBook in the Project Gutenberg site. Since it doesn t matter what text we use there I will just replace that with some of my own words... Fixed. Thanks Steven for pointing this out
