ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception on invalid content-length
If the server returns an invalid not parsable to int content legnth the method protected int getResponseContentLength in HttpMethodBase walks off the end of the Header array and throws the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The loop at line 687 in HttpMethodBase.java    for int i headers.length - 1 i 0 i starts at the end of the array but uses intead of and so walks off the end of the array on the next line if the header is invalid. If the header is valid the return statement in the try block succeeds so there is no error. The fix is simply to change the line to be    for int i headers.length -1 i 0 i Created an attachment id 10554 Patch Patch attached.
