 PATCH Remove equals from internal Comparator of ConjunctionScorer
As written the equals method is not used. The docs of java.util.Comparator have an equals with a single arg to compare the Comparator itself to another one which is hardly ever useful. Patch follows Created an attachment id 12647 Remove equals from internal comparator of conjunctionscorer You are right. An equal implementation for Comparators is not needed and the given implementation did something different.... However the Comparator is still not compatible with equal for Scorers AND a compatible Comparator is not needed. So the comment is only a warning. I applied your patch.
