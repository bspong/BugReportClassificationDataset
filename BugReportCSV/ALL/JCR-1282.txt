Publish the jackrabbit-ocm DTD
The jackrabbit-ocm DTD from jackrabbit-ocm src dtd should be made available for reference on the Jackrabbit web site.DTD published to http jackrabbit.apache.org dtd jackrabbit-ocm-1.4.dtd in revision 607984.After moving the DTD the testcases fail. Adapting the testcases with the updated URI.Actually I removed the DOCTYPE declaration alltogether because each time the descriptors where loaded the DTD is accessed which slows down the test cases considerably. Fixed in Rev. 608374Good point thanks It s good to have the DTD available online for validation and documentation but there s little need for it to actually be referenced by live configuration files.
