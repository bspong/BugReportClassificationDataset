Test class in the main source tree
org.apache.jackrabbit.core.TestRepository is in the main source folder src main java instead of the test folder src test java . The build of jackrabbit-core is successful even if I move the class to the test folder so it looks like it was just a mistake.Committed in revision 745041I introduced the TestRepository class in JCR-368 to make it easier for people to submit new test cases that they could easily run both within and outside the main Jackrabbit test suite. As such it explicitly belongs to src main java. However I haven t seen anyone really use the class and I m not sure how well it even works anymore. So perhaps we should simply drop the entire class. Anyway I changed this to an improvement issue as the class being in src main java was not a mistake.
