This is an implementation of http www.illc.uva.nl Publications ResearchReports MoL-2003-02.text.pdf The only change is that I added an option to disable derivational stemming in case you want to just remove inflectional particles and possessive pronouns. In testing I found a reuse bug in this stemmer This would cause it to stem when it should not. Attached is an updated patch with a specific test for this. ok I think this one is ready. I d like to commit in a few days trunk 3x unless anyone objects. Committed revision 942235 to trunk. Committed revision 942240 to 3x. Bulk close for 3.1
