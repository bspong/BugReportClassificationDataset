Publish source javadoc jar files to the Maven repository
It would be really nice if HttpComponents Core and Client published jar files to the Maven repository for not just the bytecode but also for the source and javadoc done by defining a classifier attribute of javadoc or source for the jar when publishing with Maven . Having these in the Maven repo allows an IDE like Eclipse to auto-download and attach the source javadoc to the HttpComponent jar files - meaning developers will then see the API documentation automatically in their IDE. This also greatly aids debugging if one needs to step through HttpComponent code and placing the source in the hands of more developers also means you might see more patches coming back.Chris Would you be able to help us a little by submitting patches for core and client poms OlegDone. OlegThanks a lot Oleg And sorry for not sending patches I only knew how to do it manually - not how to attach-sources to the maven-source-plugin jar goal execution as you did
