Fix CommitIndexTask to also commit IndexReader changes
I m setting up a benchmark for LUCENE-1458 and one limitation I hit is that the CommitIndexTask doesn t commit pending changes in the IndexReader eg via DeleteByPercent using a named commit point. Simple patch. Though I changed IndexReader.commit Map String String from protected to public I m not sure why we made it protected on the first go.
