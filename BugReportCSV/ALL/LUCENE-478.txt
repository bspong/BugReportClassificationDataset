CJK char list
Seems the character list in the CJK section of the StandardTokenizer.jj is not quite complete. Following is a more complete list CJK non-alphabets u1100 - u11ff u3040 - u30ff u3130 - u318f u31f0 - u31ff u3300 - u337f u3400 - u4dbf u4e00 - u9fff uac00 - ud7a3 uf900 - ufaff uff65 - uffdc This is how the code looks currently CJ Chinese Japanese u3040 - u318f u3300 - u337f u3400 - u3d2d u4e00 - u9fff uf900 - ufaff KOREAN Korean uac00 - ud7af Are your suggested changes still needed and if so where should which range be added Chinese Japanese or Korean Yes I am. Our i18n team has provided a more up-to-date list and I thought I d contribute it back. -John John I m not sure I understand do you think that this issue can be closed now If not could you ask your i18n experts how your changes could be integrated into the current code the one where K Korean and CJ are separate things There are six classes of issues 1. A character range in StandardTokenizer.jj that is missing in John s list and should be left as-is in StandardTokenizer.jj in the CJ section 1.a. U 3100 - U 312F BoPoMoFo a.k.a. ZhuYin Phonetic transcription symbols used in Taiwan not used on mainland China. 2. A character range in StandardTokenizer.jj that is also in John s list but in the LETTER section rather than in the CJ section and should be left as-is 2.a. U 1100 - U 11FF Korean Jamo phonetic symbols 3. A character range in StandardTokenizer.jj that is not present in John s list and that should be removed from the KOREAN section in StandardTokenizer.jj 3.a. U D7A4 - U D7AF Non-character range at the end of the pre-composed Hangul Korean block 4. A character range in John s list that is missing in StandardTokenizer.jj but which was not present in Unicode 3.0 and so strictly should not be included when running on Java 1.4 since this is a non-character range in Unicode 3.0 however I think it should be included in StandardTokenizer.jj in the CJ section for future compatibility with Java 1.5 and Unicode 4.0 4.a. U 31F0 - U 31FF Japanese Katakana phonetic extensions these were introduced in Unicode version 3.2 see http www.unicode.org reports tr28 tr28-3.html 10 3 katakana 5. Character ranges in John s list that are missing in StandardTokenizer.jj and that should be added to the newly re-labeled CJ section 5.a. U FF65 - U FF9F Half-width Japanese Katakana phonetic symbols 5.b. U 3d2e - U 4DB5 non-chars U 4DB6 - U 4DBF excluded CJK Ideograph Extension A. This range was introduced in Unicode 3.0. 6. A character range in John s list that is missing in StandardTokenizer.jj and that should be added to the LETTER section since it like the U 1100 - U 11FF range already included there is a range of Korean Jamo phonetic symbols 6.a. U FFA0 - U FFDC Half-width Korean Jamo phonetic symbols Patch addressing the above-described issues Removed stray comma - obsoletes previous patch Thanks I committed Steven Rowe s patch although it doesn t seem to fully match what he said in comments above e.g. in his patch I don t see the range he mentioned in 5.b .
