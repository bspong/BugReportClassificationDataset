JSP page compilation errors when depoyed using oc4j
An error in the Welcome.jsp was produced as follows cannot find symbol symbol method log java.lang.String java.lang.Throwable In a response from the user group it was determined that there should be no expectation in Jackrabbit that the JspPage implementation will inherit from the GeneralServlet base class. Fixed in revision 698489 by removing the log statement in welcome.jsp. Repository access problems should already be logged in RepositoryAccessServlet where I now made the log output more detailed. Thanks for reporting this issue
