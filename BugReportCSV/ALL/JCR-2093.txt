Implement QueryObjectModelFactory.fullTextSearch in QueryManagerImpl
While doing the JCR-1104 upgrade to JCR 2.0 we ran into an issue on how to best handle the QueryObjectModelFactory.fullTextSearch method that seems to have changed a bit since the spi-commons version was written. Marcel can you take a look at this when you have time. The dummy implementation I added now is at line 97 of QueryManagerImpl.java in jackrabbit-core.Another somewhat related issue the LuceneQueryFactoryImpl.create FullTextSearchImpl method tries to parse the full text search expression but with the JCR 2.0 API the expression is a StaticOperand instead of a String. For now I added a simple toString call to convert the StaticOperand to something that can be parsed but there is probably a better way to do this. See line 209 in LuceneQueryFactoryImpl.java for the details.Fixed in revision 770738.
