Remove deprecated Directory stuff and IR IW open ctor hell
This patch removes primarily the deprecated Directory stuff. This also removes parts of the ctor open hell in IR and IW. IndexModifier is completely removed as deprecated too. A first version some tests may use old API which therefore not compile. This is a very tricky pert because you can do lots of errors. Things from 2.9 which were not 100 correct CompoundFileReader.list was there deprec but no listAll . Renamed function. Does listAll list difference has any effect in CFR There was one class to list in SegmentInfos replaced by listAll This patch also makes FSDir abstract and removes all deprecated methods and also the hell of reflection and the system properties. Patch still needs fine-tuning and test adaption. Does listAll list difference has any effect in CFR This should be fine we don t normally put non-index files into a CFS. Updated patch works with current trunk and backwards branch after tag was added not yet done . The previous poatch had some errors because of init methods and previous closeDir parameter wrong method was called in some cases Contrib tests not yet functional but test-core works. Here are the fixes for contrib to not use the deprecated IndexReader IndexWriter FSDir IndexSearcher methods ctors. Now this issue is ready for the final commit. It would be good if somebody other would again look over the original patch. I think I have to commit this now. The current tests in trunk do not compile as there is now a problem with abstract methods in the MockFSDirectory and FaultyFSDirectory I was too fast in modifying them and tested only with my changes from this patch . Committed revision 821446 If there are any problems caused by this let me know
