Add System.getProperty tempDir as final static to LuceneTestCase J4 
Almost every test calls System.getProperty tempDir and some of them check the return value for null. In other cases the test simply fails from within eclipse. We should add this to LuceneTestCase J4 as a static final constant. For enabling tests run in eclipse we can add a fallback to . if the Sysprop is not defined. Uwe can you default to java.io.tmpdir instead . is not properly defined. It will create indexes in the current directory where the tests run from which is different if I run ant test from root root contrib and root benchmark ... Or we can tweak common-build.xml to fallback to root test. In fact looking in common-build.xml I already see tempDir defaults to build.dir test. Look at lines 448 where it is set 417 where it is used and 418 where java.io.tmpdir is set to that value. Maybe we need to change the definition of build.dir from location build to location common.dir build so that it always references root build. And if run from eclipse default TEMP DIR constant to java.io.tmpdir Uwe can you default to java.io.tmpdir instead The problem are only test runs outside ANT. If you run the tests from ANT there is never a problem they use build.dir test which is perfectly defined. But the tempDir system property is not set when running the tests from eclipse. So Your suggestion to fallback to java.io.tmpdir is a good idea maybe with lucene-test appended. Maybe we need to change the definition of build.dir from location build to location common.dir build so that it always references root build. This would break contrib. Its defined correctly at the moment as ANT guarantees that . or the current dir defaults to the dirname build.xml . Or we can tweak common-build.xml to fallback to root test. common-build never needs a fallback as its always defined. and root test is exactly what we do not want to have as it will not be cleaned up on ant clean Here the patch. I removed almost all System.getProperty calls from tests. Only remaining are the special properties in benchmark maybe that can be solved too and System.getProperty line.separator - but that s fine. LuceneTestCaseJ4 now has two fields of type java.io.File TEMP DIR that is retrieved from system property tempDir set by ANT or if not available from java.io.tmpdir . By this tests will also run correctly from eclipse. This is static. DATA DIR deprecated that is used by some contrib tests. This should not be used instead the tests should use this.getClass .getResource getResourceAsStream which is also relative to the current tests. I did not change the tests to use this. DATA DIR is detected from system property set by ANT else it is loaded from classpath of the current test class because of that it is not static but final and initialized in the class ctor. New patch removed usage of DATA DIR again. All tests that simply needed an InputStream were converted to getResourceAsStream . Other tests that really need a File instance can use LuceneTestCase J4 .getDataFile String which was heavily borrowed from the PorterTestCase I moved the code there. Its only few tests that use this function. This is now ready to commit. Patch looks good. I see that you ve documented TEST VERSION CURRENT in LuceneTestCase J4 as Use this constant when creating Analyzers. . It s used already for creating IndexWriterConfig and I assume it will be used for other components as we ll introduce it in them LUCENE-2305 . So perhaps generalize the jdoc It bothered me for a long time that I cannot run some tests from eclipse because of this tempDir . I m glad you fixed it OK I fixed the javadocs here Thanks.
