Provide Date Header Util Methods
Hello It would be really nice to have util methods that help with setting date headers. For instance like the servlet spec s setDateHeader method. This allows for the client of HttpClient to not have to deal with formatting the date into the correct string. There is a parseDate method that turns a String into a Date. It would be nice to have the opposite method. Thanks SethThis is definitely something we should include.Created an attachment id 13288 Patch 1 Here s a quick solution for this. I ve deprecated DateParser and replaced it with DateUtil since we now have formatting routines. Please have a look and let me know. MikeLooks good. OlegPatch applied to HEAD. Mike
