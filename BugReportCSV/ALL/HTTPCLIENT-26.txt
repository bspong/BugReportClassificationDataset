need a way to set request body in PostMethod
Currently there is no way for user to set the request body in PostMethod directly. The only way to do that is by adding parameters to PostMethod. This makes sense in most cases. However there are situations that the user actually knows the request body and want to set it directly. adding the following method fixes this     public void setRequestBody String requestBody              this.requestBody requestBody      you might also want it to be byte oriented either OutputStream or byte . For instance pushing xml payload ala SOAP requires byte not String request body. I handled this case by extending PostMethod and adding a setBody byte and rewrote writeRequestBody which defers to the parent when body hasn t been set.I just added a setRequestBody String method to PostMethod. If someone wants to work on a streaming or file based form have at it but you may want to consider using PutMethod as the base instead. HTTPCLIENT-36 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug.
