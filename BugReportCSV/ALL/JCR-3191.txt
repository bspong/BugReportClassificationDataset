Update commons-io dependency from versiom 1.4 to 2.0.1
Jackrabbit may be used as JackRabbit-JCA. In many application servers we need to change the classloading policy to global or flat . These classloading policies result in many conflicts between versions of own server implementation or version of applications. It would be diminished if Jackrabbit dependences are keep up-to-date . dependency groupId commons-io groupId artifactId commons-io artifactId version 2.0.1 version dependency I ve updated to 2.2 that seems to be the latest. Fixed in rev 1307503.
