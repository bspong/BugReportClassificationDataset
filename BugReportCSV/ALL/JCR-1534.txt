Use POIExtractor wherever possible
POI scratchpad comes with a couple of text extractor utilities which makes it easier to extract text. We should rather use those utilities than writing our own extractor code. This helps avoid issues like JCR-1530.MsWordTextExtractor and MsExcelTextExtractor now use extractors from POI scratchpad. svn revision 647128
