InitiatedIndex CCE on casting NumericField to Field
An unchecked cast to List Field throws a ClassCastException when applied to for example a NumericField. Appearently this has been fixed trunk but for a 2.9.1 release this could be helpful. The patch can be applied against the 2.9.0 tag. It is to late for 2.9.1 but I apply this patch to the 2.9 branch for a possible 2.9.2. Committed revision 830775 how can I create a fix version of 2.9.2 move to 2.9.1 as we create new RC Bulk close all 2.9.1 issues.
