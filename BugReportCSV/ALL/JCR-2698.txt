Consolidate type safe wrappers for commons-collection classes
Various places define their own type safe wrappers for classes from commons-collections i.e. FilterIterator TransformIterator and the like . I would like to consolidate them into one single place.Fixed at revision 982181As mentioned in JCR-2688 I d rather avoid the commons-collections dependency in jcr-commons. Could we move these wrapper classes to spi-commons or somewhere else that already has a commons-collections dependency for other purposes Moving to spi-commons is fine. However after these classes are not will not be used from JCR-2688 anymore they are probably a bit orphaned. It might however still be handy to have them around.Resolved at revision 982707 - moved wrappers from jcr-commons to spi-commons - removed commons-collections dependency from jcr-commons
