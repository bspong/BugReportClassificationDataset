removing properties through SPI two ways to do it
Batch currently provides two ways to delete a property similarly to JCR - Batch.remove - Batch.setValue ... null JCR2SPI currently uses AFAIK Batch.remove . Proposal - clarify that the QValue argument in setValue must be non-null same for setValues I agree there should only be one way of doing this.and so do I. the Batch currently does not specify that there a multiple ways to remove a property... but it insinuates this usage by not explicitely mentioning the expected behaviour and by refering to the corresponding jcr methods. Let s clarify that in the javadoc and adjust the current implementations if necessary.extended javadoc explicitly stating that setValue setValues differs from the corresponding jcr-calls and are only intended for modification of a property. Batch remove is to be used for removal. completed at revision 649419
