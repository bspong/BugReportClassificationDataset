jcr-server should honor a webdav request s Content-Type and Content-Language headers
when processing a PUT or a POST the DavResource should have access to the Content-Type and Content-Language headers presented in the webdav request if any. when the client explicitly communicates these headers their values should take priority over server calculations such as that done in SetContentTypeCommand or at least be input into server calculations furthermore the dav getcontentlanguage is not at all supported by at least the simple webdav server. 1 Content-Language - header value is set if present retrieved from the dav resource - simple DavResourceImpl inits the content-langage dav property if it    is available from the resouce. - extended export importcontext so they honour content-language prop. 2 ContentType ContentLanguage when adding member resources modified the davresource in order to allow to pass a context rather than only an input stream to the addMember method. the context current provides contentype contentlanguage inputstream. regards angelacomitted angelas latest changes fixed in r240176
