NullPointerException may be thrown when trying to enumerate observation event listeners
When calling the ObservationManager.getRegisteredEventListeners a NullPointerException may be thrown if no event listener has been registered yet . The reason for this is that in the ClientObservationManager.getRegisteredEventListener method an internal field is access directly which is created on demand and thus may be null.Fixed in Rev. 633796 by first checking the internal fieldSchedule für rmi 1.4.1 releaseBackported to 1.4 branch for release in Rev. 636782.
