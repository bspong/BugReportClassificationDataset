spi2dav ItemInfoCache causes failure of Workspace RestoreTest testRestoreWithUUIDConflict and variants
while running the API version tests i found the Workspace RestoreTest.testRestoreWithUUIDConfict and variants failing. to be precise the test passes but transiently removing the versionableNode2 in the teardown fails upon removal of the jcr uuid property of the moved childnode. having a closer look at it revealed that the problem is caused in the WorkspaceItemStateFactory where the property entry is retrieved from the cache and subsequently checking if the path really matches fails. for test purposes i prevented the usage of the cached entry by returning false in WorkspaceItemStateFactory.isUpToDate the tests passed. as far as i know the same tests pass with spi2jcr. michael could it be that this is caused by a flaw in the iteminfo-cache logic or is there something specific that needs to be adjusted in spi2dav The root cause of this is the move operation when a referenceable node is moved to a new parent which is subsequently removed the item info cache still contains the original NodeInfo same uuid but old path which causes this test failure. I propose to WorkspaceItemStateFactory.isUpToDate method such that it returns false for cases where the paths of the cached ItemInfo and the hierarchy entry do not match. After such cache entries are stale.fixed at revision 919107
