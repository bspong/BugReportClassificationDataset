Promotion of SPI from Contrib
This has been suggested by Jukka on the dev-list 1 and i would like to start the promotion now. Apart from the promotion itself the discussion regarding distribution of common classes 2 and the related issue JCR-996 somehow depends on the promotion and i consider the latter one to be important to follow. So far nobody objected the promotion. If this is still true i will start working on that. 1 http www.mail-archive.com dev jackrabbit.apache.org msg06433.html 2 http www.mail-archive.com dev jackrabbit.apache.org msg06698.htmlI m in favor of this. If there s anything specific I can do to help please let me know. 1 Feel free to go forward My only wish about structure is that we get rid of the subproject structure in SPI and have all promoted SPI components directly at the ... repos asf jackrabbit trunk jackrabbit-spi-something level. Also see the existing READMEs and other meta files in the current release components as examples. My only wish about structure is that we get rid of the subproject... sure. that s what i planned to do.jackrabbit-spi jackrabbit-spi-commons promoted with rev. 568532with completion of issue JCR-996 i would like to complete this task and also promote jackrabbit-jcr2spi and jackrabbit-spi2jcr. objections promoted components from contrib spi - spi - spi-commons - jcr2spi - spi2jcr in addition the test-cases and the RepositoryStub implementations for the setup jcr-spi-jackrabbit have been copied from the contrib spi client project.
