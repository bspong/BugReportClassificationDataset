Event filtering by path not working as specified
When filtering node events by path the event filter doesn t compare using the associated parent path see JSR-170 8.3.3 The set of events can be filtered by specifying restrictions based on characteristics of the associated parent node of the event. The associated parent node of an event is the parent node of the item at or formerly at the path returned by Event.getPath. The following restrictions are available ¥ absPath isDeep Only events whose associated parent node is at absPath or within its subtree if isDeep is true will be received. It is permissible to register a listener for a path where no node currently exists. for property events filtering is correct To fix this the special handling of node events in EventFilter.blocks simply needs to be removed. Proposed patch. 1 I ll mention the backwards compatibility issue in the 1.4 release notes. If someone relies on the current behaviour they should delay the 1.4 upgrade until the client code is fixed. 1 I agree this should be fixed asap.Applied patch in revision 587477.The same problem exists in org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.commons.EventFilterImpl. spi.commons issues fixed with revision 587520.
