RegexCapabilities is not Serializable
The class RegexQuery is marked Serializable by its super class but it contains a RegexCapabilities which is not Serializable. Thus attempting to serialize the query results in an exception. Making RegexCapabilities serializable should be no problem since its subclasses contain only serializable classes java.util.regex.Pattern and org.apache.regexp.RE . 1 Lets add a no arg constructor to the impls and make serializable. fixed with LUCENE-2606
