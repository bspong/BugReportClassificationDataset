Need setURI methods in HttpMethod interface
I d like to have the methods setURI URI and setURI String methods. Also a method like getRequestURI because the uri I get now with the method getURI changes if I execute a request which will be automatically forwarded. The methods setURI can throw an exception if it has already been executed.Sounds reasonable and should not be very difficult to implement. Any takers OlegOk now I see a problem here. The introduction of the setURI method would require modification of the HttpMethod interface. I am not sure we want to do it at this point. Jandalf it s your call. Shall we change HttpMethod or shall we fix the bug after 2.0 release Oleg It is getting a little late in the development cycle for this enhancement as changing HttpMethodBase. URI is posed to move to its own subpackage where this change can be made after 2.0 is released.Created an attachment id 7370 Patch take 1 Looks good but I have one suggestion. If the URL is absolute the patch always creates a new HostConfiguration. This could mess up applications that call both setURI and setHostConfiguration though it s questionable why someone would call both . Maybe if the host port part of the URL is the same as the current HostConfiguration s host port setURI should leave the HostConfiguration alone Created an attachment id 7397 Patch take 2 Any objections to committing this one OlegGo for it.Patch committed.
