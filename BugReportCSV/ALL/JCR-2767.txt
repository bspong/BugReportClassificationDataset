Database connection leak with DBCP MySQL and Observers
When using DBCP and MySQL with an observer that modifies the content repository we are seeing abandoned connections in our connection pool.The connections that are being abandoned code from line 802 in org.apache.jackrabbit.core.journal.DatabaseJournal. This class has an instance variable of type org.apache.jackrabbit.core.util.db.ConnectionHelper that it treats as a thread safe object. However the batch mode features of this class do not appear to be thread safe. I have prepared a patch that makes the batch mode features of the ConnectionHelper class by moving its batchConnection into a thread local variable.This patch makes the ConnectionHelper class thread safe. This class was not thread safe when running in batch mode since all threads share the batch mode flag. This patch replaces that flag with a thread local variable so every thread accessing the helper can have its own batch connection.Good catch thanks Patch committed in revision 1004576.
