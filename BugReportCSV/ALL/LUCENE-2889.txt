Remove lucene.experimental from Numeric 
NumericRangeQuery and NumericField are now there since 2.9. It is still marked as experimental. The API stabilized and there are no changes in the public parts even in Lucene trunk no changes . Also lot s of people ask if experimental means unstable in general but it means only unstable API . I will remove the lucene.experimental from Numeric classes. NumericUtils stays with lucene.internal as it is not intended for public use. Some people use it to make TermQuery on a numeric field but this should be done using a NRQ with upper lower and included true which does not affect scoring applies also to Solr . Easy patch. 1 - go for it uwe Committed trunk revision 1063762 Committed 3.x revision 1063766 Bulk close for 3.1
