Architecture Diagrams needed for Lucene Solr and Nutch
I drew up this Nutch architecture diagram for a guest lecture I gave at USC in the CSCI572 Information Retrieval and Search Engines class 1 in 2007. 1 http www-scf.usc.edu csci572 Nutch architecture overview taken from my talk at ApacheCon 09. For Solr... Slide 9 from my Solr Beyond The Box ApacheCon 2008 has a 50 000 view of Solr s architecture... http people.apache.org hossman apachecon2008us btb Slide 5 of Yonik s original ApacheCon 2006 talk on Solr has a slightly out of date architecture box diagram... http people.apache.org yonik ApacheConEU2006 Here s a diagram for Lucene from LIA2 s chapter 1. It s an arch diagram for an overall search app showing the common stages components but it includes some components not covered by Lucene the unshaded ones and the others covered by Lucene the shaded ones . Solr arch. It would be nice if we had updated it and explained in more detail. Just for an example Update Request Handling - optional language detection - Analysing stamming lemmitazing etc. - Search Request Handling - Scoring - Soundex - etc. etc. Attaching our Solr architecture PDF from http www.cominvent.com 2011 04 04 solr-architecture-diagram
