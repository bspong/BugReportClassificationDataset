Make retrieveTerms int docNum public in MoreLikeThis
It would be useful if private PriorityQueue retrieveTerms int docNum throws IOException were public since it is similar in use to public PriorityQueue retrieveTerms Reader r throws IOException It also seems useful to add public String retrieveInterestingTerms int docNum throws IOException to mirror the one that works on Reader. I ll commit in a day or two. Perque no. I see MLT is full of tabs should you feel like fixing the formating. Perque no. Huh I see MLT is full of tabs should you feel like fixing the formating. Yeah I noticed that too and it is quite egregious but I thought we avoided formatting changes but I am happy to make an exception here. I think cosmetic changes are OK if they are not mixed with functional changes there are no patches for the cleaned-up class es in JIRA In this case I see only a couple of MLT issues all of which look like we can take care of them quickly and then somebody can clean up a little if we feel like it. Anyhow... Committed revision 662413.
