FilteredDocIdSet does not handle a case where the inner set iterator is null
DocIdSet iterator is allowed to return null when used in FilteredDocIdSet if null is returned from the inner set the FilteredDocIdSetIterator fails since it does not allow for nulls to be passed to it. The fix is simple return null in FilteredDocIdSet in the iterator method is the iterator is null. Patch attached. Tha nks for reporting this I will check and commit trunk and 3.x branch Patch with a new test that verifies this works. Fails without Shay s patch. Will commit now. Committed trunk revision 1292282 Committed 3.x revision 1292288 Thanks Shay
