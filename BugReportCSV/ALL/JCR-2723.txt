Exception when missing namespace in CND file should have clearer message
Using the attached CND file when calling CndImporter.registerNodeTypes .. the following message is in the returned exception Unable to parse CND Input Error setting name of sling resourceType to sling resourceType bundle 23.0 0 SLING-INF nodetypes types.cnd line 24 The issue with line 24 is that the sling namespace has not been included. The message should state that a namespace is missing and what prefix is not understood.types-bad.cnd is missing a namespace and causes the error noted in the description. types.good.cnd contains the sling namespace and doesn t cause an exception when importing.fixed in svn r99544
