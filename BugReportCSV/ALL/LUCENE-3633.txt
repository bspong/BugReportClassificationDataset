Remove code duplication in MultiReader DirectoryReader make everything inside final
After making IndexReader readOnly LUCENE-3606 there is no need to have completely different DirectoryReader and MultiReader the current code is heavy code duplication and violations against finalness patterns. There are only few differences in reopen and things like isCurrent getDirectory ... This issue will clean this up by introducing a hidden package-private base class for both and only handling reopen and incRef decRef different. DirectoryReader is now final and all fields in BaseMultiReader MultiReader and DirectoryReader are final now. DirectoryReader has now only static factories no public ctor anymore. Patch. Minor changes in Javadocs. No code changed will commit soon if nobody objects. 1 i was just looking at this duplication myself when looking at the docvalues case its message about use Multi SlowMultiReaderWrapper is actually wrong and duplicated in both readers . Committed trunk revision 1212844
