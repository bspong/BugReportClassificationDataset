Setting CONNECTION TIMEOUT and SO TIMEOUT on a per-method basis
The capability of setting connection timeout and socket timeout on a per-method basis should be provided. This would enable different threads sharing the same HttpClient to set different timeouts for their methods executions.I am not sure. That s not what I had in mind. In my opinion SoTimeout ConnectionTimout do not belong to the HttpMethod. These are HttpConnection parameters.Timeout parameters can still belong to HttpConnection. What is needed here is the capability for a method to reset the timeout of its HttpConnection. Connections should be enumerated in the pool or executeMethod in HttpClient should accept an HttpConnection parameter.I have spent weeks thinking about a solution to this problem. I tend to conclude that CONNECTION TIMEOUT and SO TIMEOUT should simply be moved back to the HttpMethod HttpClient level. It would be the easiest and least messy solution How do you feel about it OlegCreated an attachment id 11442 Patch take 1 Changelog The value defined at the HTTP connection level sets the initial default socket timeout value. The default socket timeout can be overridden at the HTTP method level. The default value is used if socket timeout is undefined I left connection timeout logic unchanged. Setting connection timeout at the HTTP method level does not make sense as the method may end up reusing an already open connection Let me know what you think OlegLooks good to me. MikePatch committed. Oleg
