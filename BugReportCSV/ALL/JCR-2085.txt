test case TCK maintenance for JCR 2.0
Umbrella issue for changes additions to JUnit test cases setup and config.List of missing test-cases incomplete to be updated - tests for same-named Node and Property below a given Node.   this was forbidden with JCR 1.0 and is now a mandatory feature according to the latest info available   test should be created for   - addNode   - setProperty   - move   - copy   - ... - test for the correct version being displayed in the jcr-version descriptor - Node.getIdentifier - Node.setPrimaryType - NodeTypeManager.hasNodeType String - Illegal characters in JCR Name and thus Path . Set of illegal characters has changed since JCR 1.0API Coverage as of 2009-05-08modified versioning tests to cover jcr2.0 api incomplete .JCR2.0 versioning API testsJCR-2.0 versioning tests.API coverage as of May 22 82 mainly node type management new property types and advanced versioning missing.Tests for the JCR-2.0 binary value object.API coverage as of May 28 r779574 Binary tests added with revision 779583 thanks Manfred.
