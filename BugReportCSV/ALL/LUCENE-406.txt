sort missing string fields last
A SortComparatorSource for string fields that orders documents with the sort field missing after documents with the field. This is the reverse of the default Lucene implementation. The concept and first-pass implementation was done by Chris Hostetter. Created an attachment id 15623 MissingStringLastComparatorSource Created an attachment id 15624 MissingStringLastComparatorSource Unit test and demonstration of basic functionality Changing bug type to new feature . Thanks for the unit test Chris Note to anyone who may stumble upon this issue the attached version was the initial implimentation it has since been commited to the Solr project where bug fixes improvements have been found.... http svn.apache.org viewvc incubator solr trunk src java org apache solr search MissingStringLastComparatorSource.java view log ...this issue still exists in my mind to migrate this functionality into the Lucene core .. but it s not a very urgent priority. We should update this and incorporate into Lucene. This is resolved is being resolved by the new FieldCache deleted docs support LUCENE-2671 LUCENE-2649
