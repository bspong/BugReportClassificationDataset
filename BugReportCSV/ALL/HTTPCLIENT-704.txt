Exception not caugh in DefaultResponseParser
The method hasProtocolVersion in o.a.h.message.BaseLineParser httpcore-alpha6 throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException which is not caught by the parseHead method in the o.a.h.impl.conn.DefaultResponseParser.The problem is easily reproducible and therefore should be trivial to fix. However before I can start working on a fix I have to re-sync HttpClient with HttpCore trunk 4.0-alpha7-SNAPSHOT . This turned out to be a pretty big deal as the latest changes in Http parsing code utterly broke browser compatibility and netscape cookie specs and might take a while to fix. OlegThe problem is no longer reproducible with SVN head. Apparently it has been fixed in HttpCore during the refactoring of the message parsing code. Oleg
