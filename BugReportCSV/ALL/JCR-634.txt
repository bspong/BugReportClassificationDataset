Log trace wrapper for the JCR API
I have implemented the log trace mechanism for the JCR API. A short summary - A wrapper for a Repository. All other objects that where created directly or indirectly Session Node and so on are wrapped as well. - The wrappers log all JCR method calls to a file and call the underlying methods. - Return values and calling method line number can be logged as well optional . - The log file itself is mainly Java source code and can be compiled and run. - Included is a player to re-play log files for example if the log file is too big to be compiled . The source codeCommitted the contributed code to contrib jcrlog in revision 540521. Thanks and sorry for the long delay here s a pom.xml for the jcrlog module here s a pom.xml for the jcrlog module Thanks Applied with the standard license header in revision 514273.
