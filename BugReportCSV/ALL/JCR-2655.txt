initVersions crashes with NPE
After delete some old versions. I get serious problems accessing the version history. This is the stacktrace java.lang.NullPointerException at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.version.VersionIteratorImpl.initVersions VersionIteratorImpl.java 169 at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.version.VersionIteratorImpl. init VersionIteratorImpl.java 87 at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.version.VersionIteratorImpl. init VersionIteratorImpl.java 72 at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.version.VersionHistoryImpl.getAllVersions VersionHistoryImpl.java 92 I stepped threw the code and see that the Method     currentVersion.getSuccessors returns an empty Array. After all the VersionHistory seems to be corrupt this issue is fixed by JCR-2613Sorry but the bug still exists in my repository. Update to 1.6.2 but the Exception is the same. Is the repository now corrupt yes. the issue is only fixed for new version removals. if the repository is corrupt it stays corrupt.the inconsistent versions that no longer exist in the repository should be skipped in initVersions .i will look at this before the respective releasesUnblocking 2.1.1 and 1.6.3.Fixed in revision 1000912 by making the code explicitly skip and log warnings for missing successors.Hi Jukka can I ask why you unblocked the 1.6.3 when the issue is fixed only in 2.2.0 Imho this issue is still a blocker for 1.6 branch. Would it be possible to backport the fix Also the fix in 2.2.0 seems to be just working around the problem but not attempting to fix already corrupted version history. Is there a way to fix this problem by removing the invalid versions Thanks. can I ask why you unblocked the 1.6.3 when the issue is fixed only in 2.2.0 We didn t have a fix ready in time for 1.6.3 and I considered it more important to have the other fixes in the 1.6.x branches released at the time without waiting for this fix. Would it be possible to backport the fix Backporting the fix to 1.6.x is non-trivial since the relevant code has evolved quite a bit since the 1.6 branch was created. I have now backported the fix to the 2.1 and 2.0 branches see revisions 1174686 and 1174688 . I would recommend upgrading to 2.x since we re in any case about to declare the end of life of the 1.6 branch after the next patch release. Also the fix in 2.2.0 seems to be just working around the problem but not attempting to fix already corrupted version history. Is there a way to fix this problem by removing the invalid versions I haven t tried it but with this fix in place you should be able to access and modify the version history so removing broken versions should be possible.
