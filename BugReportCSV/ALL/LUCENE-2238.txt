deprecate ChineseAnalyzer
The ChineseAnalyzer ChineseTokenizer and ChineseFilter not the smart one or CJK indexes chinese text as individual characters and removes english stopwords etc. In my opinion we should simply deprecate all of this in favor of StandardAnalyzer StandardTokenizer and StopFilter which does the same thing. 1 1 I will commit this later today if nobody objects committed in revision 904521 thanks robert
