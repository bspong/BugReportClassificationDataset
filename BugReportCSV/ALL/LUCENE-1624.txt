Don t commit an empty segments N when IW is opened with create true
If IW is opened with create true it forcefully commits an empty segments N. But really it should not if autoCommit is false nothing should be committed until commit or close is explicitly called. Spinoff from http www.nabble.com no-segments -file-found -files -Error-on-opening-index-td23219520.html Attached patch. I plan to commit in a day or so.
