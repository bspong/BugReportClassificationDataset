the demo application does not work as of 3.0
the demo application does not work. QueryParser needs a Version argument. While I am here remove author too tsk tsk - got to run that demo release manager The webapp demo too which I think we should drop just because of that - its outdated and annoying to maintain . Committed revision 888247. I got the same problem and I find the way to solve that in file results.jsp replace line 98 with the following line QueryParser qp new QueryParser Version.LUCENE CURRENT contents analyzer then it should be ok in eclipse ide there is another error tip the way to resolve that is in file footer.jsp replace line 19 with the follow line Apache Lucene Template WebApp 1.0
