Upgrade benchmark from commons-compress-1.0 to commons-compress-1.1 for 15 times faster gzip decompression
In LUCENE-1540 TrecContentSource moved from Java s GZipInputStream to common-compress 1.0. This slowed down gzip decompression by a factor of 15. Upgrading to 1.1 solves this problem. I verified that the problem is only in GZIP not in BZIP. On the way as 1.1 introduced constants for the compression methods the code can be made a bit nicer. Trivial patch for trunk. I remember seeing a compress-1.1 jar under Solr somewhere. Can u plz check if we can use only one of them under Lucene Solr I ve been thinking for some time that we need a module with common libraries used throughout the project. Something w o code only jars. I think we have several copies of some jars today especially Apache ones. Consolidate all of them in one place will be great. We can do this in a separate issue though… Consolidate all of them in one place will be great. We can do this in a separate issue though I think SOLR-2435 deals with this. In this issue I rather get this problem fixed asap so that benchmark performs best. Committed r1084210 - trunk r1084231 - 3x Bulk closing for 3.2
