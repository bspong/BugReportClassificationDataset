Improper EOL for text files on Windows
version 2.0-rc3. Improper EOL for text files on Windows for README.txt and LICENSE.txt docs .txt. The files display as one loooong line in Notepad.Is this really an issue considering WordPad will open it without any problems. Second any adjustment to the textfile format will break the presentation on other platforms. Lastly IMO Notepad is a poor excuse for a text editor. I would suggest using TextPad or UltradEdit as better alternatives.Hi Gary I have to agree Andre here. The files have EOLs it s just that Notepad doesn t like them. The releases are built on linux and as such use the standard linux EOL when they are checked out of CVS. If you know of a simple automated solution to modify EOLs for the .zip archives in Maven I will gladly accept it. If not I do not think this is something that will be changed. MikeI think I ve seen other projects to a LICENSE and README file no extension with NIX EOL and .txt files with Win EOL. Ant could copy one to the other fix the EOLs. Notepad is the default .txt editor and sure loads fast . Not a critical issue but makes folks feel better when file look normal on their OSs...Created an attachment id 11304 Patch That should do the trick. Let me know what you think OlegSeems to work for me. MikePatch committed to CVS HEAD 2.0 Oleg
