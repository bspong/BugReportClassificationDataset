Promote solr s PrefixFilter into Java Lucene s core
Solr s PrefixFilter class is not specific to Solr and seems to be of interest to core lucene users PyLucene in this case . Promoting it into the Lucene core would be helpful. Attached is a version of PrefixFilter that could be added to the Lucene core as submitted by Yura Smolsky a PyLucene user. Even though i use PrefixFilter on a daily basis in Solr and i am confident of it s correctness I don t think anything should be commited promoted to the Lucene code base without some Unit Tests. PrefixFilter is exercised by a few tests in the Solr code base at the moment but they aren t portable because they go through the SolrCore Here is another attachment by Yura providing the request unit test. The test was incorrect. I fixed it added some more tests and committed.
