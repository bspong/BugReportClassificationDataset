Node merge method doesnt seems to recurse thru childs of the right source node
I checked the NodeImpl.merge ... it seems the way it process the childs nodes is wrong as it calls the merge on the childs of the src node that come from the source workspace. plus in the case srcNode is null it would end on a NullPointerException as it does NodeIterator ni srcNode.getNodes in the second statment of the if condition Versioning operations like restore merge will soon be implemented and or adapted to the latest api spec.fixed in r157809
