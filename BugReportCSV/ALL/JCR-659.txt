import of multivalue properties with single value results in incorrect property creation
When importing a file exported with system view a value of a multivalued property is stored as a singlevalue property. The bug seems to be that for some reason even if PropDef.isMultiple is true for a given property no ValueFormatException is thrown when setting the property as single value. Workaround It works if I change PropInfo.apply line 136 to if va.length 1 def.isMultiple ... i was able to reproduce the issue with a node type that defines both a multi-valued named property and a residual single-valued property. e.g. app foo nt unstructered - app names string multiple the issue can also be reproduced by adding a mixin with a multi-valued prop to a node that includes nt unstructered.fixed in svn r484644 thanks for reporting this issue
