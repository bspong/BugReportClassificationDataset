A few new benchmark tasks
Some tasks that would be helpful to see added. Might want some expansion but here are some basic ones I have been using CommitIndexTask ReopenReaderTask SearchWithSortTask I do the sort in a similar way that the highlighting was done but another method may be better. Just would be great to have sorting. Also since there is no great field for sorting reuters date always appears to be the same I changed the id field from doc id to just id. Again maybe not the best solution but here I am to get the ball rolling I get test failures in TestQualityRun when I apply this. I am guessing it is the BasicDocMaker change. Yeah sorry about that Grant. Did not mean for that change to go in just wanted it as a stumbling block to thinking about good sort field data. At the time I needed to test non String data and there was none. So ... please ignore that change. Perhaps the best way is a new DocMaker for good sort data I think the Reuters has a data available. I forget how it is indexed off hand but you could work w that maybe. Otherwise a new DocMaker would be reasonable or perhaps see if Wikipedia offers any other fields. It does have a date...but I noticed it seems to generally be the same date for a lot of docs. Not much sorting to do when the value doesnt change much. I will take a look at the wiki maker. Here are just the tasks and the change to ReadTask to support sort. Better sort stuff - adds a new doc maker that adds a random sort field over a specified range of values allows choosing of sort type includes sample sort benchmark algorithm. I think we should do this for 2.4 Mark Grant is this ready to go in My last look at it seemed like it was in good shape but that was a while ago. Committed revision 693495.
