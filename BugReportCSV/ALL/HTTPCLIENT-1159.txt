HttpClientUtils - Helper methods to release resources of HttpClient HttpResponse after use
Found myself writing this boiler plate code in various httpclient related projects to release resources and wanted to provide a simpler way to release resources similar to IOUtils.closeQuietly as opposed to maintaining the same in my code. New class o.a.http.client.utils.HttpClientUtils added pre   public static void closeQuietly final HttpResponse response   public static void closeQuietly final HttpClient httpClient pre with 2 methods as above in the same to help release resources Revised file with test casesRemoved static logger as per coding guidelines per discussion in the mailing list. Removed logging as well as it is supposed to close quietly anyway.Catching Exception is not ideal it would be better to catch the expected exceptions and allow any others to propagate. Also there are now 3 versions of the patch attached the obsolete ones could perhaps be deleted Sebastian is absolutely right my bad for missing it . The methods should only catch and discard IOExceptions and let RuntimeExceptions propagate to the caller. You might also consider adding consumeQuietly to the EntityUtils class instead. OlegThanks Oleg and Sebb. My bad for completely missing that one. Point taken and a new patch uploaded. and the old ones removed . Also added the license header to the test class as well. Regarding EntityUtils.consumerQuietly that would probably go into httpcore and a different jira ticket hence No need for a separate JIRA. I ll sort it out. Cheers OlegWell - just logged HTTPCORE-290 and ready with the patch. Added since 4.2 to the class and the methods.Patch committed to SVN trunk with some minor changes to the test cases. I had to eliminate calls to www.google.com in order to make unit tests self-contained. Many thanks Karthik for contributing the patch. Oleg
