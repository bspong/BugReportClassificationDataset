BrowserCompatHostnameVerifier and StrictHostnameVerifier should handle wildcards in SSL certificates better
I ran into a problem with SSL wildcard certificates in the class BrowserCompatHostnameVerifier. It handles .example.org fine but server .example.org fails to work correctly. The javadoc claims that it should behave the same way as curl and FireFox. In Firefox an SSL certificate for server .example.org works fine for the host server.example.org using HttpClient it throws an exception. Here is an example test JUnit4 package org.example.hb import javax.net.ssl.SSLException import org.apache.http.conn.ssl.BrowserCompatHostnameVerifier import org.junit.Test public class BrowserCompatHostnameVerifierTest Should not throw an exeption in the verify method. throws SSLException Test public void testVerifyStringStringArrayStringArray throws SSLException BrowserCompatHostnameVerifier hv new BrowserCompatHostnameVerifier String host www.example.org String cns www .example.org hv.verify host cns cns RFC2818 says this about wildcards                                                  Names may contain the wildcard    character which is considered to match any single domain name    component or component fragment. E.g. .a.com matches foo.a.com but    not bar.foo.a.com. f .com matches foo.com but not bar.com. This implies that the StrictHostnameVerifier ought to allow wildcards for component fragments. The RFC does not say if oo.com or f o.com is allowed - are such certs ever created It does appear to disallow multiple wildcards - ... the wildcard character ... . I assume that the example f .com is bad and is not actually allowed In which case wildcards are allowed if - there are at least 2 dots i.e. 3 components - there is only one and this must be at the end of the first component - if there are 3 components and the last one has two characters then check against bad 2LDs What about server .example.com - do curl and Firefox allow this to match server.abc.example.com The matching could probably be simplified if this is not allowed. Affects AbstractVerifier which is the base for BrowserCompatHostnameVerifierBetter also affects StrictHostnameVerifier
