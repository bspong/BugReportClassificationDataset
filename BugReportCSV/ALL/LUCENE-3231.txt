Add fixed size DocValues int variants expose Arrays where possible
currently we only have variable bit packed ints implementation. for flexible scoring or loading field caches it is desirable to have fixed int implementations for 8 16 32 and 64 bit. here is a super rough patch with nocommits and even missing nocommits showing the idea. this is heavy work in progress though This looks great Simon here is a new patch adds Field API for new int types adds tests for getArray hasArray adds tests for new Int types unifies some of the existing tests adds javadocs I think we ready here... all tests pass
