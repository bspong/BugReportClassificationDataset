Jcr2Spi Warning upon reloading property values
tobi reported the following log-warning being written upon reloading property values WARN Property data has been discarded It seems to me that this has been introduced with JCR-1963. Taking a closer look at it i get the impression that the discarded flag should only be set if any values are notified accordingly. In addition it seems to me that the MergeResult should have a dispose method or something similar in order to have the replaced old property values properly released...proposed changes. michi what do you think Looks good to me. Thanks for fixing.Reopening for 1.5.0Fixed at revision 766761
