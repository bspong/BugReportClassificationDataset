I changed freeConnections.removeFirst to freeConnections.removeLast . Now the container for free connections behaves as a stack rather than a queue. 2 additionally I changed the IdleConnectionTimeoutThread in the run method I added connectionManager.deleteClosedConnections so that the pool size is maintained correctly. What do you think BalazsMike Could we also call deleteClosedConnections in the closeIdleConnections method of the MTHCP http jakarta.apache.org commons httpclient xref org apache commons httpclient MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.html 596 Otherwise looks good OlegPatch applied.
