JCR-SQL2 query with multiple columns in result only returns last column when using Row.getValues 
When running a query like below on an in-process repository via TransientRepository or via RMI access a call to Row.getValues only returns the last column selected        SELECT property1 property2 FROM nodetype QueryResult.getColumnNames returns the right set of columns. Stepping through the code shows that org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.join.AbstractRow has the implementation of getValues - this creates a new Values array then overwrites it multiple times in a for loop that iterates once per column. That doesn t sound like the desired behaviour. Getting values via individual calls to Row.getValue property1 gives the correct results. good catch thanks for reporting Nick I ve also improved an existing test to check this info as well. Fixed in revision 1303438.
