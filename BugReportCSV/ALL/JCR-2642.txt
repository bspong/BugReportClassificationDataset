JackrabbitParser and tika 0.7 parser
Hi I was trying to implement a custom parser and found the following problem. Since tika 0.7 it is possible to implement your custom parser and specify it into a service provider configuration file META-INF services org.apache.tika.parser.Parser . In this way there would be no need to maintain a custom tika-config.xml file if you d like to implement a custom parser. The problem that I had was in the JackrabbitParser because I wasn t able to instantiate the AutoDetectParser with the default constructor is will be instantiated using the default TikaConfig constructor. Basically from tika 0.7 the TikaConfig.getTikaConfig is instantiating the TikaConfig using the default constructor instead of accessing the tika-config.xml file from withing the package and reads the service provider configuration files and populate the parsers map. What I m proposing is to change the JackrabbitParser to instantiate the AutoDetectParser using the default constructor in this way the using tika version 0.7 we could easily implement our own parsers and there won t be a reason to maintain the tika-config.xml also a sort of backward compatibility would be maintained because using the AutoDetectParser default constructor the TikaConfig is instantiated using TikaConfig.getTikaConfig wich for tika versions 0.7 calls the TikaConfig InputStream constructor whcih reads the configuration directly from the package. Basically the JackrabbitParser should look like this     public JackrabbitParser              parser new AutoDetectParser        Thanks DanWe need the custom tika-config.xml file since we want to by default disable text extraction of package and image file formats to avoid excess resources being spent. However in revision 1038125 I modified our custom tika-config.xml file to use the new DefaultParser class in Tika 0.8 to automatically pick up all available parser classes through the service provider mechanism used by Tika. The selected package and image formats are still disabled by explicitly mapping them to the dummy EmptyParser class.
