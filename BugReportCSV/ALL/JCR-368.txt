Add support for simple test cases
As discussed on the mailing list I d like to add a simple org.apache.jackrabbit.core.TestRepository helper class that could be used in a simple unit test template.Attached a patch with a simple TestRepository implementation and the associated test-repository.xml configuration file. PS. Like the TransientRepository class and many other this doesn t really fit the definition of a core class but I m placing it there since at the moment there doesn t seem to be a better place and starting a new package for just one class seems quite wasteful.Hoping to get this included in 1.0-rc3.Added the TestRepository class in revision 389558 and fixed the copyright header in revision 389559 . Merged to 1.0 in revision 389564.
