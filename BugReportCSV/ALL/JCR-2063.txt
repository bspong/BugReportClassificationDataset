FileDataStore garbage collection can delete files that are still needed
It looks like the FileDataStore garbage collection both regular scan and persistence manager scan can delete files that are still needed. Currently it looks like the reason is the last access time resolution of the operating system. This is 2 seconds for FAT and Mac OS X NTFS 100 ns and 1 second for other file systems. That means file that are scanned at the very beginning are sometimes deleted because they have a later last modified time then when the scan was started.Comitted in revision 767427 trunk Merged to the 1.5 branch in revision 767555.A workaround for implementations where this is not fixed is gc.mark try      sleep to ensure the last modified time is updated      even for file system with a lower time resolution     Thread.sleep 5000 catch Exception e      can not ignore otherwise data that is in use may be deleted     throw new RepositoryException Interrupted gc.mark
