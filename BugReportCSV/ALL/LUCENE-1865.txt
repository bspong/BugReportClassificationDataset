Add a ton of missing license headers throughout test demo contrib
as of r808636 it still seems like we re missing boilerplate from several files that fit the source file criteria... http www.apache.org dev release.html which-files-contain-license This list is a subset of the rat report on the uncompressed src.zip from trunk r808636 ... lucene-2.9 contrib ant src java org apache lucene ant antlib.xml lucene-2.9 contrib db bdb build.xml lucene-2.9 contrib db bdb-je build.xml lucene-2.9 contrib lucli run.sh lucene-2.9 contrib xml-query-parser src demo WebContent index.jsp lucene-2.9 contrib xml-query-parser src demo java org apache lucene xmlparser webdemo FormBasedXmlQueryDemo.java lucene-2.9 src jsp configuration.jsp lucene-2.9 src jsp footer.jsp lucene-2.9 src jsp header.jsp lucene-2.9 src jsp index.jsp lucene-2.9 src jsp results.jsp Darn - didn t mean to miss the java one - though I knowingly skipped some of the jsp xml. I still had a lot of false positives in my stream and I m kind of tired. We can use this issue to track the rest though - I only claimed a ton untested patch fixing the files i mentioned Thanks for finishing this. Two minor license nits Mark s r808567 commit under this issue added license declarations to two files that already had them though the original declarations are slightly differently worded they contain copyright notices . These two files now each contain two license declarations contrib benchmark src java org apache lucene benchmark package.html contrib benchmark src java org apache lucene benchmark byTask package.html I don t know if it matters but the following three files contain license declarations that include copyright notices Copyright 2005 The Apache Software Foundation unlike all the license declarations Mark added recently contrib instantiated src java org apache lucene store instantiated package.html src java org apache lucene search function package.html src java org apache lucene search payloads package.html thanks ill address both Thanks a lot
