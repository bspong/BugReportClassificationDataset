dead lock while locking or unlocking nodes
JackRabbit is still hanging on the Node.lock or Node.unlock function. ... everything fine until here... s13 4 s13 5 s13 6 s13 7 - unlock s14 started. s14 1 - session.getRootNode s15 started. s15 1 s16 started. I just find this failure during the first run emtpy repository home directory . 2nd and 3th run are fine after killing the vm from first run but with already initialized repository directory these time. 1. rm -rf repository.home 2. run - hang 3. kill 4. run - ok 5. run - ok Proposed patch on SharedItemStateManager. The write lock is downgraded to a read lock before the listeners are notified. That way the SharedItemStateManager is effectively released for read access but does not allow modification while the synchronous listeners are notified giving them a consistent view of the transaction that just completed.Modified LockManagerImpl to not synchronize when updating content since this can clash with the synchronous event listener being called during a store operation. Fixed in release 239389.Other problem arises.Another concurrency issue whereas deadlock has now been removed two competing threads locking and unlocking at about the same time could invalidate each other s node representation. Thanks again to Walter Raboch for finding this issue. Fixed in r239410.
