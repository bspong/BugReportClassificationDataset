Clone support
It would be nice to have a clone method for some of the classes that don t have getters setters exposed for all of their fields. Where relevant the clone method could be in the interface so that it doesn t matter which implementing class is being used. The main interfaces that I would like to clone are HttpRequest and Cookie. I know that HttpRequest is technically part of HttpCore but the primary implementations of it are in HttpClient so I thought I would post it here. Thanks David ByrneBoth HttpRequest and Cookie may be difficult to clone by means of standard Cloneable clone partially due to the fact it is utterly broken. What we could do is to provide a Copyable interface that could be used to produce equivalent copies of complex compound objects. HTTP messages with streaming entities could buffer the content in order to make it copyable. Thoughts OlegOleg Sorry for the slow response. I ve been tied up with the holidays etc. I m not concerned if the classes aren t strictly cloneable I just want to make a copy. I hadn t considered the problems with streaming entities but your idea makes sense. Thanks David It turned out some minor changes needed to be done to AbstractHttpMessage in core in order to resolve the issue some instance variables are currently declared private final and therefore cannot be deep-copied .
