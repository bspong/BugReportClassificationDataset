3.x backwards tests are using Version.LUCENE CURRENT aren t testing backwards 
The 3.x backwards tests are mostly all using Version.LUCENE CURRENT therefore they don t always test the behavior as they should. I added TEST VERSION CURRENT 3.0 to the backwards LuceneTestCase and I think we should fix all backwards tests to use TEST VERSION CURRENT instead. attached is a patch automated find replace ... all tests pass Looks good we should really do this. I added TEST VERSION CURRENT 3.0 to the backwards LuceneTestCase and I think we should fix all backwards tests to use TEST VERSION CURRENT instead. This is not in the patch it was committed in r965592 QueryParser defaults changed setAutoGeneratedPhraseQueries and it was necessary to ensure back compat was working Committed revision 965627. Bulk close for 3.1
