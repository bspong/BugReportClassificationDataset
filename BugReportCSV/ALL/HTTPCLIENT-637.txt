Unit tests for HttpConn
HttpConn needs more test coverage. Starting at 0 . Checked in a LocalTestServer that live connection tests will run against. The server currently echoes data sent to it or generates random data. A new base class for test cases that need the server eases the pain of using it and setting up client-side helper objects. The test cases checked in with the server test the server itself rather than anything in HttpConn. Test coverage is still below 5 for API 0 for impl. Some of the socket factory and scheme stuff is called in the new base class. cheers   Roland Current status 73 - o.a.h.conn 39 - o.a.h.impl.conn 87 - o.a.h.impl.conn.tsccm With the refactored TSCCM it will now be possible to implement unit test for the connection pool and it s building classes directly. There are currently no tests at all for the SCCM and insufficient tests for the layers on top of a pool entry.
