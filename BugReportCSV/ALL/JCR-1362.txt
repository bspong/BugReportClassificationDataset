DatabaseJournal improperly finds tables in external schemas when used on Oracle
The DatabaseJournal currently calls database metadata to determine if the journal table has already been created. It uses the following code to do so ResultSet rs metaData.getTables null null tableName null The Oracle driver sometimes will return the table if it is in another schema on the same database. Other DBMS code within JackRabbit has a specific Oracle version that handles this case. In order for the journal table to be properly created Oracle databases will need the schema name included in the getTables call.I have an implementation that I can include for this issue but it also includes tablespace for Oracle and filegroup for SqlServer support. If those enhancements are OK to include I will attach the patch.More of a refactoring request but could the code that handles DB interaction be extracted to a common utility class or set of classes The current implementation violates the DRY principle and could cause additional maintenance issues in the future.The Oracle tablespace and SqlServer filegroup support have already been added see JCR-968 and JCR-1295 . The attached patch solves this issue. I agree with Chris that we should very probably think about refactoring all or most of the DB interaction into a set of utility classes. The fact that this Oracle issue has popped up three times for different parts of the code this issue JCR-814 and JCR-582 underlines the lurking maintenance problems. Committed patch in revision 686688 Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 695887.
