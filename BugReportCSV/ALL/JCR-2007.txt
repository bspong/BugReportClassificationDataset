Importing strings with special characters fails
Both Session.importXML and Workspace.importXML don t work correctly in some cases. Importing very large foreign language for example Chinese text property values could result in incorrect values on some platforms. The reason is BufferedStringValue buffers very large string to a temporary file uses the platform default encoding to read and write the text. BufferedStringValue is relatively slow on some systems when importing large texts or binary data because of using FD .sync . If an exported string value contains a carriage return r this character was truncated on some platforms. If an exported string value contains a characters with code below 32 excluding newline n and tab t - for example form feed f - the imported string value was base64 encoded. Committed in revision 752458 trunk If a string contains a characters 32 excluding newline n and tab t - for example form feed f - the imported string was base64 encoded. Q why would a string obtained from the XML parser ever contain control characters other than CR LF or TAB Julian - see the test case please.Merged to the 1.5 branch in revision 767525.
