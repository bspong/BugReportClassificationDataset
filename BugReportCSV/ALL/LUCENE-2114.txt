Improve org.apache.lucene.search.Filter Documentation and Tests to reflect per segment readers
Filter Javadoc does not mention that the Reader passed to getDocIDSet Reader could be on a per-segment basis. This caused confusion on the users-list Ð see http lucene.markmail.org message 6knz2mkqbpxjz5po q date 200912 list org.apache.lucene.java-user page 1 We should improve the javadoc and also add a testcase that reflects filtering on a per-segment basis. Attached a patch that improves the javadoc and modifies the TestFilteredSearch test to pass segment readers to getDocIdSet Looks good I ll commit shortly Ð thanks Simon Thanks Simon Need to backport to 2.9.x 3.0.x....
