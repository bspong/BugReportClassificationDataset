fix getting started demo docs
Opening a new issue for this since there are a number of problems... We should get the versions right eg when we explain how to do a src checkout it should point to the path for that release Source checkout build JARs instructions must be updated for the merger Analyzers JAR must be on the classpath too Demo sources are no longer shipped in a binary release Fixup from LUCENE-2923 remove web app new command-line ops for IndexFiles etc. I think Steven addressed this issue already... I did some minor cleanups typos don t link to unversioned trunk resources since this is a versioned document etc . I think this one is still left to do Demo sources are no longer shipped in a binary release Demo sources are no longer shipped in a binary release Hmm i missed this Can we simplify this and just tell users to download the source release reopening to address the issue of demo source code being in the binary checkout... we should either include it or change the demo instructions to tell people to get the demo sources from the source release I added to the demo-part-2 instructions that you should get a source checkout. Bulk close for 3.1
