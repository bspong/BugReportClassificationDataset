add a tokenfilter for icu transforms
I pulled the ICUTransformFilter out of LUCENE-1488 and create an issue for it here. This is a tokenfilter that applies an ICU Transliterator which is a context-sensitive way to transform text. These are typically rule-based and you can use ones included with ICU such as Traditional-Simplified or you can make your own from your own set of rules. User s Guide http userguide.icu-project.org transforms general Rule Tutorial http userguide.icu-project.org transforms general rules attached is a patch its a little ugly since CharTermAttribute doesn t implement Replaceable Go for it its a private impl class what should we do else. Speed speed speed. Its better than coping into a StringBuilder before and after. Even Java 6 has no Replaceable interface Thanks Uwe i will remove the crude benchmark as you can bench tokenfilters with benchmark and add some examples and stuff to overview.html attached is an updated patch with examples in the overview etc. I would like to commit at the end of the day if no one objects. Committed revision 937039. backported to 3x revision 941698 Bulk close for 3.1
