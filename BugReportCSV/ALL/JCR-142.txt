allow subclassing of NodeTypeReader
in working towards an offline tool to import custom namespaces and node types i found that i needed to make some small changes to NodeTypeReader and DOMWalker so that i could subclass NodeTypeReader and access the namespaces specified in the node type definition file. see the attached patch. any comments on this issue these changes have been very useful to me in building a command line tool that can register custom namespaces and nodetypes in a repository see http svn.osafoundation.org server commons trunk jackrabbit .I m sorry for not acting on this issue sooner. I was a bit occupied at times during the summer and didn t really notice this issue until now. The changes you proposed were committed in revision 290470 with some modifications. I actually made the main NodeTypeReader methods public instead protected to facilitate composition in addition to inheritance as an extension mechanism. I also didn t change any of the DOMWalker functionality as the getNamespaces method should always return the namespace registrations of the current element. Instead i changed the NodeTypeReader to cache the top-level namespaces as a private property that is accessible through the proposed getter method. Thanks for reporting the issue I hope that the committed changes cover the functionality you need even if the issue was pending so long.
