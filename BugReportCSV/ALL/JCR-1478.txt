Perform random operation tests
As discussed on the mailing list and in other jira issues it makes sense to execute tests that perform random operations on the repository. This helps us detect concurrency issues in jackrabbit and increase code coverage.Committed a first version of tests in revision 637157 The tests are currently disabled. If you want to run them set RandomOperationTest NUM THREADS to 1 or higher.The latest commit revision 638362 introduced a new private variable log in AbstractConcurrencyTest. Unfortunately the derived class ConcurrentReadWriteTest referenced the public variable log in JUnitTest of type LogPrintWriter which is now hidden and building jackrabbit-core fails Users dpfister Projects jackrabbit jackrabbit-core src test java org apache jackrabbit core ConcurrentReadWriteTest.java 102 8 log has private access in org.apache.jackrabbit.core.AbstractConcurrencyTest oops sorry about that. Fixed it in revision 638393Random tests are in place and part of the DailyIntegrationTest suite. Resolving this issue as fixed.
