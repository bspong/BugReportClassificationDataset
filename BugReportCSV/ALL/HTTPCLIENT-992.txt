cache should not generate stale responses to requests explicitly requesting first-hand or fresh ones
The current implementation will serve a stale response in the case that it has a stale cache entry but revalidation with the origin fails. However the RFC says we SHOULD NOT do this if the client explicitly requested a first-hand or fresh response via no-cache max-age max-stale or min-fresh . The attached patch addresses this issue by either propagating the IOException for no-cache requests or by generating a 504 Gateway Timeout error. This patch is contributed to the ASF with the permission of my employer. By the way here was something I could use a little input on behavior-wise Suppose we have a cache entry dated 10 seconds ago with Cache-Control max-age 5 . This is now 5 seconds stale and has an age of 10 seconds. If a client asks for this entry with Cache-Control max-age 20 what should we do if the revalidation with the origin fails a return the stale cache entry as the overall age of the request is less than the max-age requested b return a 504 Gateway Timeout since max-age on a request assumes the cache entry is still fresh and just tightens the freshness constraints if the client was ok with a stale entry they would have used max-stale instead The current patch does a preferring to returning a stale entry over a 504 error but I am actually leaning a little towards b now. I think max-age on a request means I want a fresh response no older than this . I ve attached a patch that implements option b above if so desired. This patch is contributed to the ASF with the permission of my employer. Answered my own question by reading the RFC max-age     Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is no greater than the specified time in seconds. Unless max- stale directive is also included the client is not willing to accept a stale response. So option b is actually the correct behavior here. Committed option B. Oleg
