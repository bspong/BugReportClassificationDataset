Add missing license headers
There are a few source files and a number of other files with missing or incorrect license headers within the Jackrabbit source tree. See the discusssion at http thread.gmane.org gmane.comp.apache.jackrabbit.devel 8698 for details. The missing license headers need to be added. There are also W3C licensed files. This needs to be mentioned in the NOTICE file.Attached a patch that to my best knowledge adds all missing license headers. I already got a confirmation from David for adjusting the files committed by Day employees but there are also a few files JMX files in JCR-RMI JBoss files in JCA from Edgar that need the license headers. Edgar can you confirm that it s OK for me to add those license headers A few points worth notice I implemented explicit comment support the syntax for the database schema files to allow license headers I didn t add license headers to JAAS configuration files since there seems to be no documented syntax for comments I didn t add license headers to the expected test output files to avoid comparison issues I assumed that the MIME type and HTTP status code lists in jcr-server are either original works or copies from within the ASF 1 for yukka s patch Edgar can you confirm that it s OK for me to add those license headers it s okFixed by applying the above patch and updating the NOTICE and LICENSE files.
