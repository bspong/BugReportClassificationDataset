JEDirectory delete issue
JEDirectory is not deleting files properly. Blocks are left behind due to an error in cursor operations. I ve attached a test that exercises the bug and a corrected File.java I went from not deleting enough blocks to deleting too many which is really a much bigger problem. The attached test and fix work well. Your changes were integrated and committed rev 394214 . Please please please in the future when sending fixes in send a proper patch as generated by svn diff. Thanks.
