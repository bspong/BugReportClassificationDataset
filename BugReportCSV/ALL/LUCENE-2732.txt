Fix charset problems in XML loading in HyphenationCompoundWordTokenFilter also Solr s loader from schema 
As said in LUCENE-2731 the handling of XML in HyphenationCompoundWordTokenFilter is broken and breaks XML 1.0 5th edition spec totally. You should never supply a Reader to any XML api unless you have internal character data e.g. created programmatically . Also you should supply a system id as resolving external entities does not work. The loader from files is much more broken it always open the file as a Reader and then passes it to InputSource. Instead it should point filename directly to InputSource. This issue will fix it in trunk and use InputSource in Solr but will still supply the Reader possibility in previous versions deprecated . Patch that fixes XML parsing to apply first move the hyphenation.dtd to the src resource folder. This patch also removed the hardcoded DTD from the parser and moves it to the resources folder loaded by classloader . Solr is fixed to use the InputSource API but it shozuld really use an URL so ResourceLoader in Solr should be fixed to also supply URLs like ClassLoader Updated patch uses Locale.ENGLISH as noted by Robert. Also leaves the DTD in place Solr Lucene tests but it is never parsed only if you would view the xml in the tests in your favourite XML reader Committed truk revision 1029345 Now backporting...
