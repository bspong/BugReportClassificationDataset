CacheClient Javadoc and Constants usage cleanup
CacheClient has some empty public java doc on methods that are not get set. These should have some body. Also the HeaderConstants Class has some overlap with the existing HTTP class for header values. These need cleaning up.Clean up all javadoc as much as possible in preparation for full release. Also review HeaderConstants Class for overlap with other existing definitions for the same items in the HTTP class and other classes in Http Components.Patch checked in. Many thanks Joe
