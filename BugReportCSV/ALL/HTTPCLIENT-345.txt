 CONTRIB SSL authenticating protocol socket factory
Here s the long promised SSL client server authenticating socket factory. This socket factory can be used to enforce client server authentication during the SSL context negotiation. Let me know what you think. Please please someone proof-read the accompanying javadocs and let me know if the text is comprehensible I have also tweaked EasySSLProtocolSocketFactory a little The patch is against HTTPCLIENT 2 0 BRANCH OlegCreated an attachment id 11699 Patch take 1 Oleg I haven t tested any of the code but from looking through it I only have two suggestions 1 The various INFO log messaged should probably be switched to DEBUG. 2 The javadocs at the top of AuthSSLProtocolSocketFactory seem to have some duplicated text. In particular the tops of paragraphs 2 4. MikeMike 1 The various INFO log messaged should probably be switched to DEBUG. No problem. I ll convert INFO logs to DEBUG prior to committing the patch 2 The javadocs at the top of AuthSSLProtocolSocketFactory seem to have some duplicated text. In particular the tops of paragraphs 2 4. These two paragraphs may appear the same but they are not. Paragraph 2 deals with server authentication and trust stores whereas paragraph 4 talks about client authentication and key stores. As always I admit that my writing may leave much more to be desired. Feel free to make any corrections that you deem necessary to improve the javadocs language-wise OlegFolks if nobody objects loudly I ll commit the patch shortly. I d still appreciate someone s proof-reading the javadocs though. OlegPatch committed to 2.0 branch. Needs to be ported to CVS HEAD OlegCommitted to CVS HEAD Oleg
