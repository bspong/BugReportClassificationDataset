Database persistence managers log database and driver name and version
Database related problems can be solved more easily when we know what database and driver version is used. Sometimes multiple database drivers are installed in an app server environment and the user may not even know it. Currently the driver class name is logged. I suggest to log the driver and database name and version as well.Revision 573272 Log the driver and database name and version. Also log a warning when using an older Oracle version with the newer Oracle persistence manager.Merged with adaptations for JCR-940 JCR-1400 to the 1.3 branch in revision 631379.
