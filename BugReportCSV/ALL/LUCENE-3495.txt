BlockJoinQuery doesn t implement boost
After reviewing LUCENE-3494 i checked other queries and noticed that BlockJoinQuery currently throws UOE for getBoost and setBoost throw new UnsupportedOperationException this query cannot support boosting please use childQuery.setBoost instead I don t think we can safely do that in queries because other parts of lucene rely upon this working... for example BQs rewrite when it has a single clause and erases itself. So I think we should just pass down the boost to the inner weight. 1 looks good Bulk close after release of 3.5
