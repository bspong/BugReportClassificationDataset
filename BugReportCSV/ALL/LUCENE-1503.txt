refactor spatial contrib Filter Query classes
From erik s comments in LUCENE-1387 DistanceQuery is awkwardly named. It s not an extends Query.... it s a POJO with helpers. Maybe DistanceQueryFactory but it creates a Filter also CartesianPolyFilter is not a Filter but CartesianShapeFilter is this patch renames CartesianPolyFilter CartesianPolyFilterBuilder DistanceQuery DistanceQueryBuilder now everything that ends in Filter is a lucene Filter and everything that ends in Query is a lucene Query.
