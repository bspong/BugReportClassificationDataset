System Reqs page should be release specific
The System Requirements page currently under the Main- Resources section of the website should be part of a given version s documentation since it will be changing for a given release. I will deprecate the existing one but leave it in place with a message to cover the existing releases that don t have this but will also add it to the release docs for future releases. We can keep the existing one until 3.0 is released. I am not so familar with forrest what is to do to add a new page Just create and link a new XML file see http wiki.apache.org jakarta-lucene HowToUpdateTheWebsite simon On this page is nothing new I already know how to change the web sites. I think I have to read the forrest docs to find out how to change the menu and add new pages. Here a patch for version specific sysreqs. One patch apllies to trunk the other to the site. Please tell me if this is ok I would commit it before packaging the RC. Committed trunk changes revision 880660 Committed site changes revision 880665
