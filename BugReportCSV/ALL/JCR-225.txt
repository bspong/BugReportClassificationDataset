LockInfo.logginOut SessionImpl javadoc does not correspond to executed code
       inheritDoc       p       When the owning session is logging out we have to perform some       operations depending on the lock type.       1 If the lock was session-scoped we unlock the node.       2 If the lock was open-scoped we remove the lock token       from the session.           public void loggingOut SessionImpl session         if live             if sessionScoped                 lockMgr.unlock this              else                 if session.equals lockHolder                     lockHolder null                                             if 2 is true the lockToken is not removed from the session at least not within the method . regards angelaThis method is invoked at the time a session is logging out that is the session gets invalidated. The javadoc does not correspond to the actual implementation of course but the net effect is the same since the session s lock token are no longer accessible. Therefore lowering priority.since dominique is on vacation briefly discussed this with stefan. since Session.addLockToken getLockTokens removeLockTokens cannot throw and do not perform sanity-checks we decided to remove the locktoken from the session. hope that s ok. regards angelafixed rev. 344124
