When we move to java 1.5 in 3.0 we should replace all Interger Long etc construction with .valueOf
-128 to 128 are guaranteed to be cached and using valueOf in that case is 3.5 times faster than using contructor ...and also StringBuffers This patch changes all new Number code parts with Number.valueOf changed using find sed . All tests pass. I want to commit this as soon as possible because it affects lots of files and I do not want to get this patch outdated. The StringBuffer from previous comment is in another issue. Committed revision 821186 I hope nobody has problems with merging caused by this I hope nobody has problems with merging caused by this Pfff - so many good merge tools out there today lets not let that get in the way of this sweet rapid movement to java 1.5 If anyone is annoyed I d be happy to merge any patch for them. Uwe I agree with what Mark said. my previous comment on LUCENE-1936 really was just me wanting to stay out of your way not the other way around
