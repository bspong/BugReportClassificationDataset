Add support for custom ExecutorServices in ParallelMultiSearcher
Right now the ParallelMultiSearcher uses a cachedThreadPool which is limitless and a poor choice for a web application given the threaded nature of the requests say a webapp with tomcat-default 200 threads and 100 indexes could be looking at 2000 searching threads pretty easily . Support for adding a custom ExecutorService is pretty trivial. Patch forthcoming. Patch to added ticketed support. 1 Patch looks great I ll commit Edward Ð thanks Thanks Edward Bulk close for 3.1
