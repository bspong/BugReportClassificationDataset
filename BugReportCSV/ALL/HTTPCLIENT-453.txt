Virtual host setting does not apply when parsing and matching cookies
Virtual host setting does not apply when parsing and matching cookies. Problem has been reported on the httpclient-dev list by Dan LevineCreated an attachment id 14915 Patch take1 This should take care of the problem. Dan could you please test this patch against SVN trunk in your environment OlegLooks right to me. However if the virtual host parameter was not set but a Host header has been added instead the code should also check for that.Odi I am not sure about that. In many instances HttpClient does not take into account request headers that are manually set by the user. I do not think we should make an exception for the Host header. If someone manually overrides the Host header he she should also be prepared to manually manage cookies as well at least IMO. OlegOkay fair enough. The is the virtual host parameter that should be used and we should not encourage messing with the Host header. Fine with me.That fixes my testcase. Thank you Dan please leave changing the bug status to the committers. Thanks. Patch has not yet been applied. Reopening. sorry Patch committed to SVN trunk and HTTPCLIENT 2 0 BRANCH Oleg
