JSR 283 EventJournal
Implement the event journal as specified in JSR 283.EventJournal interface in jackrabbit-api. This is only preliminary and will be removed when JSR 283 is final.Proposed patch for jackrabbit-core. I opened up one of the methods in AbstractJournal. The method getRecords long is now public and has been moved to the interface Journal. I also added a method getRecords without parameters which allows one to walk the whole journal. An event journal can only be obtained by a session that contains the AdminPrincipal. Regular access right checks seems inappropriate because there are cases where lots of additional information would be required. E.g. consider a newly created user. Does he have access to past events How do you find out which events were created before the user was created etc.Updated jackrabbit-core.patch. The previous version contained changes from JCR-1839.Applied jackrabbit-api.patch in revision 713958Applied jackrabbit-core.patch with minor changes. For testing the MemoryJournal is used. svn revision 713964
