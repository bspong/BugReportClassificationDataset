Add a testing implementation for DocumentsWriterPerThreadPool
currently we only have one impl for DocumentsWriterPerThreadPool. We should add some more to make sure the interface is sufficient and to beef up tests. For testing I m working on a randomized impl. selecting and locking states randomly. here is a patch adding a RandomDWTPool selected if newIndexWriterConfig is used. All tests pass I am going to commit this soon if nobody objects 1 this looks great
