Exception shouldn t be thrown for unsupported authentication method
Currently Authenticator will throw an UnsupportedOperationException for unsupported authentication method like NTLM . This is correct. However HttpMethodBase.execute only catches HttpException so this UnsupportedOperationException is leaked to the user. This is undesirable because user may want a chance to handle such such authentication themself. The correct way is to pass the http status code to the user just like how it treats redirect to a different host. The simple fix is to catch all exceptions in HttpMethodBase.execute when calling Authenticator.authenticate.Created an attachment id 2322 Proposed solution to this bug Proposed fix is attached.
