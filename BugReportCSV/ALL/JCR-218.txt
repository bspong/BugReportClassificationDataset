 JCR-RMI Have ClientItem.isSame throw RepositoryException
Currently the ClientItem.isSame Item method wraps a RepositoryException thrown from the path comparison into a RuntimeException and omits an exception declaration on the method. This contrasts with the API specification which allows for a RepositoryExcption to be thrown. I suggest to modify ClientItem.isSame Item such that the RepositoryException is declared and thrown.Proposed patch. This patch also includes an modification to the type test we just compare the isNode result of both items to decide whether they are both items or properties.Patch applied in revision 290433. Thanks for the suggestion and patch
