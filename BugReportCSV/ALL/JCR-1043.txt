Package names for spring project do not match update ocm packages
The spring package and tests reference the old graffitto package naming scheme.Here is a directory structure with refactored files that will work. I tried to do a svn diff but with the directory changes it was fairly unhappy. Not being a subversion expert a tar ball was easier.Here is a patch based on the latest version of the ocm-mapping project.Thanks for the update. I can work on it from now. Do you have the pom.xml file for maven 2 It should be nice to migrate to a more recent Spring version. If needed I can do itI was about to make a jira ticket for that as well I already started moving to maven 2 and will make sure yo upgrade to the newest spring. Pih Not sent from my iPhone Updated to move things to maven2Patch applied thanks We have to continue to work on it because the unit test fails. It seems that the JCR support in the Spring module used an old version of Jackrabbit which is not compatible with the OCM stuff.Hi After working on this with Christophe I have submitted OCM Spring support to springmodules project with some small modifications http jira.springframework.org browse MOD-446 The Spring support looks better thanks to the work made by Pradraic Sebastien. I have also review the project - Use OCM annotations for the unit test - Migrate to junit 4 - Simplify the Spring config file upgrade to the latest version. - Update to the latest Spring module version for the JCR support - Remove the nodetypes which are not necessary from OCM 1.5 snapshot Let me know if something is wrong
