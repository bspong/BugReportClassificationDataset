repository-1.5.dtd change order of main elements
Currently the order of elements in repository.xml is ELEMENT Repository FileSystem Security Workspaces Workspace Versioning SearchIndex Cluster DataStore I would like to change it to ELEMENT Repository Cluster FileSystem DataStore Security Workspaces Workspace Versioning SearchIndex because I think that makes more sense. Currently XML validation is disabled and therefore the order of elements in the DTD does not need to match the repository.xml file. However as soon as XML validation is enabled repository.xml files that use the wrong order will no longer work the repository can not be started . There is a request to enable XML validation at http issues.apache.org jira browse JCR-1462 I d rather not break things for people who may be validating the repository.xml. At least a change like this requires an update to the DTD version. Also for better backwards compatibility I d make it with an informal rule that you can have only a single Cluster configuration element ELEMENT Repository Cluster FileSystem DataStore Security Workspaces Workspace Versioning Cluster SearchIndex Or even allowing more flexibility at the cost of some extra code and potential confusion ELEMENT Repository Cluster FileSystem DataStore Security Workspaces Workspace Versioning SearchIndex 1 for allowing an arbitrary order of elements - there is just no semantics for the order. Unfortunately you can no longer specify required and optional elements with the DTD mechanism. But switching to xsd or another schema is probably overkill here. We can still spit out warnings errors in Jackrabbits configuration parser if required elements are missing - or is that already the case ELEMENT Repository Cluster FileSystem DataStore Security Workspaces Workspace Versioning SearchIndex This would allow same name siblings for example multiple Cluster elements in the same repository.xml. I d rather not break things for people who may be validating the repository.xml. While I don t have any numbers I don t think many people do validate the repository.xml. Remember also we already broke all existing old repository.xml configurations by adding SecurityManager in Security . I agree the order of elements does not seem to be important but I would rather have a strict order than not detecting typos as we do now . We can still spit out warnings errors in Jackrabbits configuration parser if required elements are missing - or is that already the case Yes that already works I have removed the top FileSystem element and got the exception javax.jcr.RepositoryException Invalid repository configuration repository.xml Configuration element FileSystem not found in Repository. Configuration element FileSystem not found in Repository. At least a change like this requires an update to the DTD version. I don t think we did that in the past. Jackrabbit 1.4 uses repository-1.4.dtd. repository-1.5.dtd is only used in the Jackrabbt trunk. I don t think changes in the unreleased Jackrabbit 1.5 requires an update in the DTD version. Using repository-1.6.dtd for Jackrabbit 1.5 would be confusing. So I still like to change it to ELEMENT Repository Cluster FileSystem DataStore Security Workspaces Workspace Versioning SearchIndex What do you think Yep it s fine if the modified DTD is named jackrabbit-1.5.dtd. But I don t want to introduce before going to 2.x a change that breaks existing configuration files even if the breakage affects just validation and won t break a functional repository. Keeping the extra Cluster around there or allowing arbitrary order of elements is a minor inconvenience. More notably your argument is essentially that it would be better to reorder the Cluster element. What s to say that someone else doesn t like some other element say the search configuration being more prominent If we oblige your wish in this case and I don t see why we shouldn t then IMHO the logical solution would be to allow arbitrary ordering of elements in general instead of fixing just this one special case. I understand the concern. In this case the best solution is probably ELEMENT Repository Cluster FileSystem DataStore Security Workspaces Workspace Versioning SearchIndex Committed in revision 697708The latest version of the 1.5 DTD is now revision 721465 also on the web site.
