JSR 283 Access Nodes and Properties by Array of NameGlob 
The proposed final draft contains new variants of Node.getNodes and Node.getProperties - Node.getNodes String nameGlobs - Node.getProperties String nameGlobs see section 5.2.2 Iterating Over Child Items and 5.2.2.2 Name Globsimplemented in svn r773588This still needs test coverage in fact the JCR 1.0 variant using multiple patterns separated with needs to be tested as well .WRT test coverage TCK please create separate issue1 In NodeImpl getProperties String invokes a filter collecting nodes not properties 2 I don t see any code that will take care of the different whitespace handling requirements so there may be another bug lurking there.Re 2 .. I see that is implemented in ChildrenCollectorFilter sorry.fixed 1 in svn r791520 thanks Test case NodeReadMethodsTest.testGetPropertiesNamePatternArray is still failing currently disabled in known.issues .NodeReadMethodsTest.testGetPropertiesNamePatternArray is IMO wrong. the test expects the following pattern array to match exactly 1 entry new String jcr primaryType jcr primaryType the implementation returns an empty iterator. the spec clearly distinguishes between Name Pattern 5.2.2.1 and Name Glob 5.2.2.2 . the latter doesn t need to interpret the pipe metacharacter at least that s my understanding of spec and relevant javadoc.Stefan you are right I somehow thought that both the new variant was also supposed to allow . I will fix the test case. Sorry.
