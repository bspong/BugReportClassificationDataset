Text.escapeIllegalJCRChars should be adjusted to match the 2.0 set of illegal chars
Text.escapeIllegalJCRChars still contains chars that were illegal in JCR 1.0 but were removed from the set for JCR 2.0Patch removing single and double quote from the escape-illegal-jcr-char method. If I remember correctly this is the only needed change.
