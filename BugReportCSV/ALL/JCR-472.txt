Hi On 6 30 06 David Kennedy davek us.ibm.com wrote When invoking session.getNodeByUUID and passing an invalid ID an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. Should this be wrapped in an ItemNotFoundException or RepositoryException by SessionImpl Good point an ItemNotFoundException would probably be best. Could you please file a Jira issue for this BR Jukka ZittingAttached a proposed fix for this.think ItemNotFoundException is misleading and inconsistent RepositoryException would IMO be more appropriate. api methods in jackrabbit that take path arguments throw RepositoryException rather than PathNotFoundException if the path format is incorrect.Stefan think ItemNotFoundException is misleading and inconsistent RepositoryException would IMO be more appropriate. OK that s reasonable. Attached a modified patch invalid-uuid.r418741.patch that throws a RepositoryException. Attached a modified patch invalid-uuid.r418741.patch that throws a RepositoryException.
