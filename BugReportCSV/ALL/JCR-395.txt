Using transactions leads to memory leak
There is global static map in XASessionImpl class which stores all Xids and TransactionContexts            Global transactions           private static final Map txGlobal new HashMap It looks like this map is never cleared even after end of transaction. It leads to memory leak because TransactionContexts and all nested objects including XASessionImpl are still referenced and couldn t be freed. Proposed solution Is it posssible to add just single line which will remove TransactionContext from static map at the end of transaction       if flags TMSUCCESS flags TMFAIL             associate null txGlobal.remove xid          else if flags TMSUSPEND             associate null          else             throw new XAException XAException.XAER INVAL          If this is not acceptable then we have to unreference TransactionContext in another way.fixed. New Revision 393452 After fix transactions doesn t work at all. I m not familiar with Jackrabbit code but it looks that end method is not good place to clear TransactionContext because it is stil needed by commit rollback methods. Probably it should be done in commit rollback methods. Fixed as suggested in revision 394937.Merged for 1.0.1 in revision 409542.
