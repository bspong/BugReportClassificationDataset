In IndexSearcher class make subReader and docCount arrays protected so sub classes can access them
Please make these two member variables protected so subclasses can access them e.g. protected IndexReader subReaders protected int docStarts Thanks 1 We should also reserve future non back compatibility mark them expert subject to suddenly change . i would also like to see a protected constructor that takes IndexSearcher IndexReader reader IndexReader subReaders int docOffsets this way a subclass can avoid any constructor costs and pass exactly the sub readers offsets it wants this constructor would also be marked expert subject to change of course Attached patch making the members protected added expert ctor. Thanks John Tim
