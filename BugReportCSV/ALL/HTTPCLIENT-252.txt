Cookie Strict Mode independent of regular Strict Mode
Hi I m having a problem where a web site I m trying to access is using strict cookies on one line and a 302 redirect that fails in strict mode. So I cannot access this website because in strict mode it fails because of the 302 redirect and in non-strict mode the website doesn t recognize the Cookies on separate lines. I d love to see this added for the next release candidate. Thanks BrentBrent We are aware of the problem and are planning to address it the next release currently planned as 2.1. with HttpClient 2.0 you can still work the problem around by turning off automatic redirects and handling redirects manually.
