DirListingExportHandler Should not implement PropertyHandler
issue found by Roland Porath if the DirListingExportHandler is used with some other collection nodetype that nt folder that may allow other properties the list of dav properties obtained upon PROPFIND being delegated to PropertyHandler results in an imcomplete list. since the only benefit of the DirListingExportHandler is to display something nice upon a GET to a folder i d suggest to remove the implementation of PropertyHandler from the DirListingExportHandler. angelasuggested fix - remove DirListingExportHandler from PropertyHander list in WEBINF config.xml - remove DirListingExportHandler from default population PropertyManagerImpl.getDefault - for backwards compat. keep DirListingExportHandler implementing PropertyHandler but   always return false upon PropertyHandler.canExportfixed as suggested not tested
