Remove DocumentBuilder interface from facet module
The facet module contains an interface called DocumentBuilder which contains a single method build Document it s a builder API . We use it in my company to standardize how different modules populate a Document object. I ve included it with the facet contribution so that things will compile with as few code changes as possible. Now it s time to do some cleanup and I d like to start with this interface. If people think that this interface is useful to reside in core then I don t mind moving it there. But otherwise let s remove it from the code. It has only one impl in the facet module CategoryDocumentBuilder and we can certainly do without the interface. More so it s under o.a.l package which is inappropriate IMO. If it s moved to core it should be under o.a.l.document. If people see any problem with that please speak up. I will do the changes and post a patch here shortly. I think we should just remove it This is really an app-level thing and I think overkill for Lucene s one usage of it. 1 to remove. Alltogether it looks too much XML DOM tree like it s only missing DocumentBuilderFactory Patch against 3x but easy to apply on trunk as well . I will commit this soon. Committed revision 1196471 3x . Committed revision 1196474 trunk . Bulk close after release of 3.5
