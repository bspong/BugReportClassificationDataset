Rename Analyzer.reusableTokenStream to tokenStream 
All Analysis consumers now use reusableTokenStream . To finally make reuse mandatory lets rename resuableTokenStream to tokenStream removing the old tokenStream method . Patch which does what is described above. Everything passes. Yay awesome This is the end of reusableTokenStream If I remember correctly this work has started in late 2009 and now it seems it only one commit away Thanks chris 1 though i have a few additional suggestions TokenStream.reset is described by the docs as optional i think we should adjust the docs here. We might be able to re-word some of the stuff in Analyzer javadocs about inconsistencies Since these are gone New patch which improves documentation on TokenStream.reset and Analyzer. 1 to commit Committed revision 1176728.
