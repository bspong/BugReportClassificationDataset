URI reference resolution fails examples in RFC 3986
org.apache.http.client.utils.URIUtils.resolve final URI baseURI URI reference fails to resolve some examples from RFC 3986 section 5.3 correctly. See TestCase.Johannes I get 6 test failures locally. However in all 6 cases HttpClient merely passes the call onto JRE s method URI URI resolve URI uri . The URI resolution itself is handled by JRE code. I am afraid there is simply not much we can do about it. This problem should be reported to OpenJDK Sun Oracle developers. Alternatively one could consider contributing a new implementation of that method completely independent from JRE code but I personally think we ought not duplicate URI functionality provided by the platform.
