TokenStream Tokenizer TokenFilter Token javadoc improvements
Some of the javadoc for the new TokenStream Tokenizer TokenFilter Token APIs had javadoc errors. To the best of my knowledge I corrected these and refined the copy a bit. Patch against trunk 829452 Patch looks good thanks Luke I ll commit to trunk shortly. Unfortunately the patch doesn t apply cleanly to 2.9.x Ð can you post a version that does Or we can commit only to trunk... . OK I back-ported the javadoc improvements to 2.9.x and just committed. Thanks Luke Bulk close all 2.9.1 issues.
