Patch to JCR-RMI contribution adding Version VersionHistory support
Hi Jukka You contributed the famous RMI extension to Jackrabbit. Many thanks. On my way to implement an Eclipse plugin to access repositories this provides great help. Unfortunately your contribution does not include support for versioning yet. I took the freedom to add this missing piece and provide it to you to add it to your contribution. Thanks.The patch attached has been created relative to the jcr-rmi contribution directory.Cool many thanks I browsed through your changes and everything seems to be in order. Nice work I ll commit the changes once svn.apache.org is back online it seems to be down at the moment .Patch applied at revision 159670.
