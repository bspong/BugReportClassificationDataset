Add SessionImpl isAdminOrSystem
we have several places in jackrabbit-core where we need to find out if the executing session is either a SystemSession or corresponds to the admin user. currently the same code analysing the sessions subject is copied throughout jackrabbit-core. i would like to replace that by a helper method on SessionImpl.while working on this i felt that it was more appropriate to distinguish the two cases and therefore added isAdmin and isSystem . the implementation of the latter in SessionImpl still has a TODO as we may have both SessionImpl and SystemSession instances that must be treated as system in order to be compatible with the previous code. however i feel that at some point we should clear this up. the issue is due to the fact that SystemSession doesn t have its own createSession method.
