Remove Unnecessary NULL check in FindSegmentsFile - cleanup
FindSegmentsFile accesses the member directory in line 579 while performing a null check in 592. The null check is unnecessary as if directory is null line 579 would throw a NPE. I removed the null check and made the member directory final. In addition I added a null check in the constructor as If the value is null we should catch it asap. Thanks I was working on this class some days ago I will apply this Thanks Comitted revision 784094. This was my fault because I refactored the class and missed to remove this unnecessary check. Before there was also support for java.io.File instead of o.a.l.store.Directory in this class for which this null-check was. I removed the initial null check in the ctor as it is not necessary this class is internal only and never called with NULL directory .
