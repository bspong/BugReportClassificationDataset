Crash when adding node to cluster with big journal on PSQL DB
When adding a new node to a cluster with big journal on PSQL database application runs out of memory on the new node and crashes no exception application exits with code 137 . It s because with PSQL when no fetchSize is specified all the results of query are loaded into memory before being passed to application. Furthermore specification of fetchSize only works in transactional mode and have no effect if autoCommit is true. these are configured in ConnectionHelper The way I solved this but it s not very clean and possibly can cause side effects. batchMode on connHelper is required to connect to PSQL in transactional mode this can cause problem if DatabaseJournal.conHelper is used meanwhile for writing to DB. Then there s explicit specification of fetchMode in ConnectionHelper.reallyExec which would be called for all database interactions I couldn t find a better way to just call it for connection used for doSync. It seems harmless but I m not sure also the size I have used 10000 may not be the best.Nice thanks Patch committed in revision 1060431. See also revision 1060434 for minor improvements. Merged to the 2.2 branch in revision 1060445.
