TestUTF32ToUTF8 can run forever
Stress testing this particular test uncovered that the testRandomRanges testcase can run forever depending on the random numbers picked... Attached patch more carefully mapping around the surrogates. I also fixed LuceneTestCase J4 to pre-print the random seed if -Dtests.verbose is specified. This is important for tests that hit an infinite loop
