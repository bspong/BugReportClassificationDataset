Remove query handler idleTime
The changes included in JCR-415 revealed a synchronization issue with the query handler idle timer task. See thread on dev-list http thread.gmane.org gmane.comp.apache.jackrabbit.devel 10199 We could either fix the synchronization issue in the SearchManager class or remove the functionality all together. Because the repository also supports a idle time parameter for the whole workspace maxIdleTime in Workspaces element the query handler idle time should be removed.Fixed in trunk in revision 492164 Jackrabbit will log a warn message when it encounters an existing configuration with an idleTime parameter but will not respect it anymore.
