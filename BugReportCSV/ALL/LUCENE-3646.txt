throw exception for fieldcache on a non-atomic reader
In Lucene 4.0 we go through a lot of effort to prevent slow uses of non-atomic readers DirectoryReader MultiReader etc throw exception if you don t try to access postings or docvalues apis per-segment etc. But the biggest trap of all is still too easy to fall into we don t do the same for FieldCache. I think we should throw exception forcing the user to either change their code or use a SlowMultiReaderWrapper. Attached is an initial patch... all tests pass. 1 looks great. Nice how few places required SlowMR wrapping.... 1 let s get rid of this I only comitted a change to FieldCacheImpl that made the 2 listeners reused and per-instance of FCImpl. A small relict of very old code already fixed when we redid the listeners. The patch was just very old . I just fixed in the attached patch will commit now. I just committed a last chance to register a purge event if the slow reader does not even have a IndexReader instance as cache key like SlowMultiReaderWrapper .
