primaryItemName is not inherited
if no primaryItemName is defined for a nodetype definition it should be inherited from one of the supertypes. the spec is unclear about this though it seems to be the natural behaviour. for example when extending nt resource the subtype should not be force to redefine the jcr data as primaryItemName. spec should clarify the exact behaviour first...The spec does not define any rules for how inheritance among node types works because it was judged to be part of node type creation which is outside the scope of the spec. Of course maybe this judgement was wrong but that was the original reason.Ok as per offline discussion inheritance rules affect behavior of node type discovery methods therefore inhgeritance rules belong in the spec.closing resolved issue
