bugs in ByteArrayDataInput
ByteArrayDataInput has a byte ctor but it doesn t actually work some things like readVint will work others will fail due to asserts . The problem is it doesnt set things like limit in the ctor... I think the ctor should call reset Most code using this passes null to the ctor to initialize it then uses reset instead they could just call ByteArrayInput BytesRef.EMPTY BYTES if they want to do that. finally reset s limit looks like it should be offset len also i think we want to assert all bounds checks in here maybe have a checkBounds int limit called only from assert that throws read past EOF . this way we don t rely upon AIOOBE we could be reading from slices and miss bugs in tests.
