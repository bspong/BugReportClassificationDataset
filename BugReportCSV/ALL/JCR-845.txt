Links Pointing to Javadocs Are Incorrect and Return 404
There are various links on the Configuring Jackrabbit page http jackrabbit.apache.org doc config.html that are invalid. For example I wanted to read the PersistenceManager javadocs link but it returns a 404. This will decrease the confidence in the project and hinder its adoption.fix is attached.Patch applied in revision 529887. Thanks
