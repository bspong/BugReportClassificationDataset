Add user manager performance tests
We should add some performance tests for validating JCR-2710 and related. That is we should measure performance for creating users and groups and adding removing users to from groups. This should be done for both repository configurations one with the old content model group membership in property and one with the new content model introduced with JCR-2710 group membership in b-tree like node structure .Fixed at revision 989584 Added performance tests for creating users adding users to groups checking group membership and getting the members of a group.Following some results from the new performance tests. Using the new group members content model introduced with JCR-2710 adding members to groups is significantly faster.

See the attached patch for some improvements designed to avoid this problem and to leverage some recent test suite extras like getScale and loginWriter .Thanks for the patch. However the semantics of AddGroupMembersTest changed the intent of the original test was to measure the performance of adding many users thousands to a group. The changed test measures performance of adding a few users to a group 100 . The same applies to CreateUserTest respectively. I edited the patch to regain the original semantics while preserving your fixes and ran the performance tests AddGroupMembersTest min 10 50 90 max 2.2-btree-usermanager-repository 146 152 189 259 341 2.2-default-usermanager-repository 789 930 1945 2875 3205 GroupMemberLookupTest min 10 50 90 max 2.2-btree-usermanager-repository 749 755 766 779 1289 2.2-default-usermanager-repository 1176 1179 1203 1257 1310 CreateUserTest min 10 50 90 max 2.2-btree-usermanager-repository 1189 1303 1648 2127 2161 2.2-default-usermanager-repository 1181 1386 1981 2895 3278 GroupGetMembersTest min 10 50 90 max 2.2-btree-usermanager-repository 6 6 7 11 87 2.2-default-usermanager-repository 4 4 5 8 17 I ll commit the edited patch to trunk in a minute. Committed Jukka s patch with modifications as explained in revision 1025979
