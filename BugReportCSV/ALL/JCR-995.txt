Release the OCM component
The contrib jackrabbit-jcr-mapping jcr-mapping should be promoted from contrib into a jackrabbit-jcr-ocm component.Can we also contriburte the jcr-nodemanagement Maybe with the following structure jackrabbit-jcr-ocm      core      nodemanagementChristophe what s the status in jcr-mapping Ready for an upgrade to trunk and going out in Jackrabbit 1.4 Yes I think so. I just made a small fix in the nodemanagement pck change . I m working with Sébastien Deleuze on the Spring integration. We will send the patch the Spring module team. So it is not necessary to move the Spring subproject to the trunk. Upgraded the jackrabbit-ocm and jackrabbit-ocm-nodemanagement components from sandbox to Jackrabbit trunk in revisions 607620 and 607621. To switch existing checkouts to the new locations use the following commands     cd path to checkout of jackrabbit-jcr-mapping jcr-mapping     svn switch https svn.apache.org repos asf jackrabbit trunk jackrabbit-ocm     cd path to checkout of jackrabbit-jcr-mapping jcr-nodemanagement     svn switch https svn.apache.org repos asf jackrabbit trunk jackrabbit-ocm-nodemanagement Or just scrap the previous checkouts and do a fresh checkout or update an existing one of https svn.apache.org repos asf jackrabbit trunk.
