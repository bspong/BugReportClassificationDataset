spi2dav Query offset not respected
the TCK query test SetOffsetTest fails in the setup jcr2spi - spi2dav ex - jcr-server. not sure whether it is due to missing implementation on client or server part of something completely different....Some more info about what s the actual issue is here JCR-2884Further investigation showed me that the requiredNamespace is null but node.getNamespaceURI is can we assume that null in XML namespace speak That should fix the problem then.Attached is a simple patch which solves the issue.the TODO you mention in the JCR-2884 means that the code isn t completed yet and that we in fact should use a namespace. the patch you added isn t a proper fix for the half-way implementation of the query offset. could you please file a separate issue for your findings about the namespace mismatch thanksThe new issue is at JCR-2888 with the same patch attached.so is this issue resolved now The test indeed passes now so in revision 1226750 I removed them from the known.issues exclusion list. Resolving as fixed.
