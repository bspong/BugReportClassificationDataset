unicode escapes in files generated by JJTree
Maven build fails on windows machines if sources are located in a directory starting with a u . This is because files created by JJTree javacc put filename and path in a comment of the generated files like this bgen jjtree Generated By JJTree Do not edit this line. D usr projects workspace jackrabbit target generated-src main org apache jackrabbit core query sql JCRSQL.jj The u in interpreted as an escape characted and so you get a BUILD FAILED ... Invalid escape character This seems to be fixed in JavaCC 4.0 see https javacc.dev.java.net issues show bug.cgi id 81 I ll see if we could upgrade our JavaCC dependency. Fixed in trunk and 1.5 by upgrading to JavaCC 4.0.
