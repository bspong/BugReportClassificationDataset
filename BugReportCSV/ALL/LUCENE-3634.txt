remove old static main methods in core
We have a few random static main methods that I think are very rarely used... we should remove them IndexReader UTF32ToUTF8 English . The IndexReader main lets you list extract the sub-files from a CFS... I think we should move this to a new tool in contrib misc.

I agree I was about to remove the IndexReader one while heavy cleaning up. Let s move that to contrib misc. Patch. I moved IR s main to new CompoundFileExtractor tool in contrib misc and removed other random main methods. I moved English.java to test-framework and fixed module benchmark to use ICU to do that thanks Robert . I also removed some dead code. I think it s ready.
