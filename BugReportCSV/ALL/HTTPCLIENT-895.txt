Log creation impairs performance
Running JProfiler on a program that uses HttpClient with a ThreadSafeClientConnManager revealed that 5 of the time was spent constructing Log instances in class ClientParamsStack. Oleg did some further investigation and found that DefaultRequestDirector also has the same problem. A simple solution would be to make the Log a static member variable and do this on all classes for consistency. However this might not be the best solution for interoperating with some frameworks see http wiki.apache.org jakarta-commons Logging StaticLog Another solution would be to simply remove the Log from the affected classes although they are presumably there for a reason... The second solution would also mean that there is a risk this bug might resurface in the future either in the same class or in another part of the library by the introduction of a Log. So the static solution would be better in this respect.Tony Could you please test the patch You will need the latest SVN snapshot to apply it. OlegI do not think that reverting back to using static logs would be such a good idea. We just need to make sure that no Log object lookups take place on critical execution paths. That is there no Log objects should be created on a per request basis. Objects created in the course of request execution should be reusing Log object of the HttpClient instance. OlegThe patch is for DefaultRequestDirector.java revision 885491 and fails to apply properly needs manual fixing as the revision I just got from SVN is 885603. Please advise. When I ran my manually patched version there was a performance improvement on a small number of benchmarks I ran I am seeing upto 10 improvement in my threads dealing with responses .Oops regarding the last comment - I had checked out the 4.0 tag rather than the trunk which is why the patch didn t apply smoothly...Fixed in SVN trunk and 4.0.x branch. Please review test Oleg
