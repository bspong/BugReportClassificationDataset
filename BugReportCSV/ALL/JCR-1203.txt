Reorganize test suites
I d like to better organize the test setup in jackrabbit-core. The current test repository is located in applications test and managed with custom ant tasks and explicit do init do test surefire configuration. It would be better to have the test repository located in target repository with template content coming from src test repository and managed using the Maven 2 integration test lifecycle phases.jackrabbit-core tests now work as follows mvn package runs only the local unit tests mvn install runs also the full jackrabbit-jcr-tests suite mvn clean removes all generated files including logsAlso jackrabbit-jca needs to be modifiedUpdated jackrabbit-jca in revision 608450.
