investigate solr test failures using flex
We have a branch of Solr located here https svn.apache.org repos asf lucene solr branches solr Currently all the tests pass with lucene trunk jars. I plopped in the flex jars and they do not so I thought these might be interesting to look at. attached is a very small patch to the Solr branch so it will compile against flex jars. So awesome that we are at the point where we can do this Thanks Robert... The bug was... if you asked for TermsEnum on a non-existent field on a foreign IndexReader like Solr s SolrIndexReader so that the emulate flex API on top of non-flex API layer is used then the returned TermsEnum would incorrectly return 1 term and then null when it should ve returned null right off. I ll commit shortly Ð simple fix. With this all Solr s tests pass when you drop in the flex JARs Yay. Solr can now run on flex
