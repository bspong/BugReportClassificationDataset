better payload testing with mockanalyzer
MockAnalyzer currently always indexes some fixed-length payloads. Instead it should decide for each field randomly and remember it for that field if the field should index no payloads at all field should index fixed length payloads field should index variable length payloads. I committed this revision 1091132 . I want hudson to chug away on this... if there are lots of false fails or problems i can revert. finished the monster merge to branch 3x revision 1091277 Bulk closing for 3.2
