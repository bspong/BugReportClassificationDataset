expose shutdown method in o.a.j.jndi.BindableRepository
see http thread.gmane.org gmane.comp.apache.jackrabbit.devel 3680 The proposed patch that should fix the problem detailed in a recent conversation about shutting down jackrabbit.BindableRepository is a jndi support specific class. rather than allowing every jndi client to shutdown the repository instance retrieved from the jndi registry i think a cleaner approach would be to explicitly through a boolean argument or implicitly shutdown the repository instance in RegistryHelper.unregisterRepository. i guess the code that explicitly instantiated a RepositoyInstance is also responsible for shutting it down. i suggest to remove to public modifiers of BindableRepository and shutdown and add a boolean shutdown to RegistryHelper.unregisterRepository.I agree it has sense that if the webapp doesn t start it it shouldn t shut it down. I didn t add an argument please add it if you prefer the explicit shutdown . thanks for your suggestion. fixed in rev. 306970.
