StandardTokenizer loses Korean characters
While using StandardAnalyzer exp. StandardTokenizer with Korean text stream StandardTokenizer ignores the Korean characters. This is because the definition of CJK token in StandardTokenizer.jj JavaCC file doesn t have enough range covering Korean syllables described in Unicode character map. This patch adds one line of 0xAC00 0xD7AF the Korean syllables range to the StandardTokenizer.jj code. This patch adds one line of 0xAC00 0xD7AF the Korean syllables range to the StandardTokenizer.jj code. Committed. Thanks Cheolgoo. I m closing this issue... but some unit tests would be nice to go along with this too eventually
