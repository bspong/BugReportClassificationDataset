Upgrade contrib bdb-persistence to work w Jackrabbit 1.3
The bdb-persistence PM in contrib should be upgraded to work w Jackrabbit 1.3.1Patches should be applied to each file and then the Java files must be moved into a new package org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.bdb. Once this is done the old files should be removed. project.xml needs patching to change to Jackrabbit 1.3.1 and add a new dependency because Jackrabbit is now split up differently than it was in 1.1. The Berkeley DB version was also updated to the latest available for download. Once applied bdb-persistence is no longer compatible with Jackrabbit 1.1 or older. It might be compatible with versions between 1.1 and 1.3.1 but I have only tested with 1.3.1.committed provided patches untested. fixed in svn r575723
