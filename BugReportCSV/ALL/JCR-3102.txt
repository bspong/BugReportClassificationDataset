InternalVersion.getFrozenNode confused about root version 
It seems the javadoc for InternalVersion.getFrozenNode is confused       Returns the frozen node of this version or code null code if this is       the root version. AFAIU the frozen node of the root version is always present to capture the node type of the versionable node. Does anybody recall how this got here SVN says it has been there forever It looks like the null reference in javadoc was added in revision 122838 based on code from revision 53784 2 . So this dates back to time before JCR 1.0. I guess the javadoc is simply outdated and refers back to the initial idea of the root version not having any frozen state. AFAICT the idea of including basic details of the node in the root version came a bit later. 1 http svn.apache.org viewvc view revision revision 122838 2 http svn.apache.org viewvc view revision revision 53784with r1180054
