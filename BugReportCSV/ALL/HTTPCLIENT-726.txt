review TSCCM for spurious wakeups
Review the code of the TSCCM ConnPoolByRoute for places where spurious wakeups may happen. Verify that this case is dealt with correctly. Unit test by giving invalid wakeup signals The only a wait is in WaitingThread the spurious wakeups are handled in ConnPoolByRoute. I ve implemented a testcase and the Clover counts indicated that I even caught one real spurious wakeup in addition to the simulated ones - For the curious in ConnPoolByRoute.getEntry ... is the following code block if waitingThread null     waitingThread         newWaitingThread poolLock.newCondition rospl The condition is false only if a spurious wakeup is being handled. The testcase generates three simulated ones. If the count indicates that the block has been skipped more often you know that a real spurious wakeup has occurred. cheers   Roland
