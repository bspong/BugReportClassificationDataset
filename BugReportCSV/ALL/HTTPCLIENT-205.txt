HttpMethodBase String incorrectly encoding URI
The HttpMethodBase String constructor is handling URIs incorrectly. The Javadocs indicate that the given URI should already be escaped but the constructor uses the URI constructor for unescaped URIs.Created an attachment id 6173 patch Please let me know if this looks good and I will commit it tonight. MikeMike I do not particularly like the fact that the input string has to converted to an array of char only to be converted back to a string the very next moment. I guess we should provide an additional constructor for the URI class. Besides I find URI constructors a bit odd. Is there any particular reason why escaped uri should be passed as an array of chars whereas unescaped uri should be passed as strings and not visa versa It s too late to change anything about it. I just find it weird. OlegI agree it is strange. Seems like a flag would be more appropriate. Perhaps someone will tackle URI for our 2.X release. Mikepatch applied.
