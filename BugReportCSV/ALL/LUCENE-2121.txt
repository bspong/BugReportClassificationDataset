add UnicodeUtil.nextValidUTF16String
In flex branch TermRef must not contain unpaired surrogates etc. But in trunk previous releases people could and do seek to these. Also some lucene multitermqueries will generate these invalid seek locations even now which we should separately fix I think the common case is already handled with a hack in SegmentReader.LegacyTermEnum but we should clean up this hack and handle all cases. I would also like to use this nextValidUTF16String in LUCENE-1606 and there might be other places it could be used for better bw compat. here is a new patch Mike is heavy committing so the old one is out of date. This looks good Ð I d say commit it to flex Thanks Robert Committed revision 887706. sorry I forgot to svn add the testcase. Committed revision 887708. the TestUnicodeUtil
