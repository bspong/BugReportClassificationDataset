CharArraySet cannot be made generic because it violates the Set interface
I tried to make CharArraySet using generics extends AbstractSet char but this is not possible as it e.g. returns sometimes String instances in the Iterator instead of . Also its addAll method accepts both String and char . I think this class is a complete mis-design and violates almost everything sorry . What to do Make it Set or just place a big SuppressWarnings unchecked in front of it Because of this problem also a lot of Set declarations inside StopAnalyzer cannot be made generic as you never know whats inside. This is the only possibility to make it somehow genericfied. As all Object subclasses so everything contains a toString method it is no longer a problem to add any object that has a valid String representation to this set. It is only strange that the iterator returns Strings and not char - why is this so To fix this there is also an accessor to get an Iterator String correctly casted. Add some java docs. Will commit now. Committed revision 826395
