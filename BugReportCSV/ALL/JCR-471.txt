Create resource sensitive cache for item states
there is currently a lru-caching strategy for the itemstates in the shared ism with a hardcoded limit of 1000 entries. the problem is that the size of the states is not respected in the caching strategy this poses a problem if the states are large i.e. large values in property states or large number of childnode entries .added a memory sensitive cache with a default size of 8mb. the sizes of the item states are more or less accurate.
