When A URL is redirected there is no easy way to encode the new url before HC tries to execute it 
When you implement your custom RedirectHandler there is no easy way to encode the new URL being redirected to. A public method to access the location string prior to the URI generation would be useful.This patch is for 4.0.3-RELEASE Provides an exposed method for convenience when having to encode redirected URIs.Ryan Please have a look at HttpClient 4.1-alpha2 release or SVN trunk. The DefaultRedirectStrategy class in 4.1 has a very similar method protected URI createLocationURI final String location throws ProtocolException I can commit the patch but it is very unlikely there will be another official release off the 4.0.x branch. Please consider upgrading to 4.1. OlegHi Oleg Thanks for the advice that did the trick. Ryan
