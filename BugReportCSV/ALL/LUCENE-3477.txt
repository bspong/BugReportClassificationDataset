Fix JFlex tokenizer compiler warnings
We get lots of distracting fallthrough warnings running ant compile in modules analysis from the tokenizers generated from JFlex. Digging a bit they actually do look spooky. So I managed to edit the JFlex inputs to insert a bunch of break statements in our rules but I have no idea if this is right dangerous and it seems a bit weird having to do such insertions of naked breaks. But this does fix all the warnings and all tests pass... Patch. Also fixes several other warnings in modules . Great idea All these seem to be identical fall-throughs to breaks . Looks fine to me. Thanks Mike All these seem to be identical fall-throughs to breaks . Looks fine to me. Right I too checked all of the locations and as you say all fall-throughs were to cases that were break-only. This was likely intentionally generated code rather than spookiness and given that it s not intended to be user modifiable probably not a problem or source of potential future problems. That said JFlex code generation should add breaks for emtpy comment-only user-supplied action code or at least turn off fallthrough warnings with a compiler directive. The real problem here is the warnings which Mike s patch fixes. Having to add naked breaks does seem weird but it s functional. I successfully regenerated from the .jflex sources ant jflex under modules analysis common and all tests pass. 1 Is it possible before committing to add some comments to explain the breaks e.g. instead of - Not numeric word ideographic hiragana or SE Asian ignore it. break Not numeric word ideographic hiragana or SE Asian ignore it. maybe - Not numeric word ideographic hiragana or SE Asian ignore it. this break suppresses jflex warning break Not numeric word ideographic hiragana or SE Asian ignore it. This way they don t get lost... OK I ll add the comment and commit Bulk close after release of 3.5
