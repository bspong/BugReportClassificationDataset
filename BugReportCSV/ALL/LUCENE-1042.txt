discrepancy in getTermFreqVector-methods
getTermFreqVector int TermVectorMapper never calls the mapper if there is no term vector consitent with all the other getTermFreqVector methods that returns null. getTermFreqVector int String TermVectorMapper throws an IOException when a field does not contain the term vector. My suggestion Index src java org apache lucene index SegmentReader.java src java org apache lucene index SegmentReader.java revision 590149 src java org apache lucene index SegmentReader.java working copy -648 7 648 7 ensureOpen FieldInfo fi fieldInfos.fieldInfo field if fi null fi.storeTermVector termVectorsReaderOrig null - throw new IOException field does not contain term vectors return There seems to be some inconsistency across the board with all the methods here. I ll have to dig into the history here of the older methods and see what is the best solution. We probably should have the same across the board instead of the grab bag approach now in place. committed thanks Karl
