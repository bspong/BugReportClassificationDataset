Implement getDistance on DirectSpellChecker.INTERNAL LEVENSHTEIN
DirectSpellChecker.INTERNAL LEVENSHTEIN is currently not a full-fledged implementation of StringDistance. But an full implementation is needed for Solr s SpellCheckComponent.finishStage and also would be helpful for those trying to take the advice given in LIA 2nd ed section sect8.5.3. Thanks for opening this issue James. I updated the patch for just a one-off comparator merging distributed results termsenum fuzzytermsenum automata construction is very costly so I just implemented this the standard way as LuceneLevenshteinDistance . Just like before DirectSpellChecker doesn t actually use this code but the distances computations are equivalent. fix dyslexic patch name and add another test term that will fail if the distance measure doesn t act like lucene s
