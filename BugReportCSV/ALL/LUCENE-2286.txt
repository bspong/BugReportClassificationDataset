enable DefaultSimilarity.setDiscountOverlaps by default
I think we should enable setDiscountOverlaps in DefaultSimilarity by default. If you are using synonyms or commongrams or a number of other 0-posInc-term-injecting methods these currently screw up your length normalization. These terms have a position increment of zero so they shouldnt count towards the length of the document. I ve done relevance tests with persian showing the difference is significant and i think its a big trap to anyone using synonyms etc your relevance can actually get worse if you don t flip this boolean flag. attached is a patch with backwards-break in CHANGES. 1 Patch looks good trivial . ok i will commit in a few days if no one objects. In my opinion the backwards break is the easiest way to go. in practice it won t hurt existing docs and if someone is concerned about bad ranking because the newly indexed docs suddenly are ranked better they can turn this off with the boolean until the get a chance to reindex all docs. Committed revision 917148. according to CHANGES.txt this fix is in branch 3x as well. Bulk close for 3.1
