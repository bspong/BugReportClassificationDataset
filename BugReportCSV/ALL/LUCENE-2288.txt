Create EMPTY ARGS constsant in SnowballProgram instead of allocating new Object 0 
Instead of allocating new Object 0 create a proper constant in SnowballProgram. The same for new Class 0 is created in Among although it s less critical because Among is called from static initializers ... Patch will follow shortly. Patch w the trivial change. Forgot to mention all analysis tests pass. thanks Shai the patch looks good to me though i hope it only affects the Lovins stemmer or in case someone has written their own Snowball stemmer as the others should not be using this reflection will commit in a few days unless someone objects. Thanks Robert. I never checked if those methods are actually code as I didn t do it to earn any CPU cycles back. I just followed good coding practice and since it appeared in two places thought that a constant will look like a bit less waste. If you re sure those are not called by the other stemmers and I m sure you are then I m fine if you leave those out as well Committed revision 917161. Thanks Shai
