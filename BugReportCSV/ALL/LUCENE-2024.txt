 ant dist no longer generates md5 s for the top-level artifacts
Mark hit this for 2.9.0 and I just hit it again for 2.9.1. It used to work... I looked into this and found no reason why the artifacts are not signed. Which ones are missing. The main tar and zip files all have signature files. Here a patch that uses the most recent checksum task. I have to checkout what the minimum ant version is now. It is more simple now. I aso added sha1 sums. It is also faster than before. Mark Mike can you test this on your computers The file output pattern needs ANT 1.7.0. Attached is a patch that raises the version number in BUILD.txt too the website also needs to be updated . Is this a problem 1.7.0 is now also 2 years old and as we go to Java 1.5 we could also raise our build requirements. Mark Mike can you test this on your computers It worked And I also just verified on trunk ant dist fails to produce the sha1 md5 digests. Is this a problem 1.7.0 is now also 2 years old and as we go to Java 1.5 we could also raise our build requirements. I think this is reasonable. But what version is installed on hudson But what version is installed on hudson Can you check this for me I still have no hudson account... Thanks OK looks like hudson is using ant 1.7.1. So we re good Committed revision 835889 Thanks all On ApacheCon the others told me to open an issue in INFRA to get an account I could then also take the clover update. I ll try.
