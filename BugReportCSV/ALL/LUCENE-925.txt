Analysis Package Level Javadocs
Analysis package level javadocs need improving. An overview of what an Analyzer does and maybe some sample code showing how to write you own Analyzer Tokenizer and TokenFilter would be really helpful. Bonus would be some discussion on best practices for achieving performance during analysis. First crack at some Analysis level javadocs. All comments welcome. Could use a bit more on best practices maybe but has a good intro I think to the main concepts. Please let me know of changes by 6 14 07 otherwise I will commit to branch and trunk. Very concise I like it I fixed two typos and added some more info text it is less concise now I am considering adding some further discussion of things like position-Increment analysis at indexing vs. search and some simple code snippets - hope to have that tomorrow. I see your patch Doron and raise you one patch. Added some info on stemming etc. and a disclaimer about sentence breaking. Looks good. I shortened the stemming bikes bike example and moved it to the stemming bullet. Looks good to me. I will stand by my commitment to commit sometime tomorrow. Committed to branch 2.2 and trunk Later than I d hoped an extended analysis package doc. Reopening this issue b c can t attache a file without re-opening. Attached adds some code samples and adds these sections Invoking the Analyzer Indexing Analysis vs. Search Analysis - Field Section Boundaries - Token Position Increments As today is the last day to commit javadoc issues I am hoping for some quick feedback... Doron I read the new sections... really good stuff and definitely useful I also like that you added more Wikipedia links. My 1 for committing. Great thanks for reviewing Michael I will commit then. Committed to branch 2.2 and trunk btw removed few differences between trunk and branch 2.2 for this file .
