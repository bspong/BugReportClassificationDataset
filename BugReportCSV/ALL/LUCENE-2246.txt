While indexing Turkish web pages Parse Aborted Lexical error.... occurs
When I try to index Turkish page if there is a Turkish specific character in the HTML specific tag HTML parser gives Parse Aborted Lexical error.on ... line error. For this case IMG SRC .. images head.jpg WIDTH 570 HEIGHT 47 BORDER 0 ALT exception address character which has 351 ascii value as an error. OR õ character in title tag. a title õõõ Turkish character in the content do not create any problem. I suppose you use demo which comes with Lucene. Then try add JAVA UNICODE ESCAPE true without quotes into options in HTMLParser.jj and regenrate lexical analyzer javacc HTMLParser.jj . That solve problem for me.
