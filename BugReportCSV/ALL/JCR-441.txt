Session logout doesn t release locks acquired using addLockToken
Session.addLockToken doesn t register locks with the session so when logout is called they are not released. Locks acquired this way maintain a reference to the Session after logout and new sessions attempting to acquire the locks will fail.This patch includes the test case originally supplied and a possible fix.fixed in svn r480587 rod thanks for this excellent bug report and patch. ... and my excuses that it took so long. this issue somehow managed to escape my radar The fix for JCR-641 also fix this issue Paco Avila commented on JCR-441 The fix for JCR-641 also fix this issue yes. JCR-441 and JCR-641 both refer to the same problem.Sorry I posted this message before you closed the JCR-441 bug
