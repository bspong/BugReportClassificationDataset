 PATCH BitSetQuery FastPrefixQuery FastWildcardQuery and FastQueryParser
FastPrefixQuery and FastWildcardQuery rewrites to BitSetQuery instead of OR ed BooleanQuery s. A BitSetQuery contains a BitSet that desginates which document should be included in the search result. BitSetQuery cannot be used by itself with MultiSearcher as of now. Created an attachment id 15708 BitSetQuery Created an attachment id 15709 BitSetScorer Created an attachment id 15710 FastPrefixQuery Created an attachment id 15711 FastWildcardQuery Created an attachment id 15712 FastQueryParser that uses both FastPrefixQuery and FastWildcardQuery In BitSetScorer the skipTo target method could also use the nextSetBit method on the BitSet. Regards Paul Elschot MultiSearchableQuery is missing Created an attachment id 15753 MultiSearchableQuery MultiSearchableQuery just to get things compiled. Unless someone objects this can be closed. The constantscore rewrite option on multi-term queries covers this. I agree Mark Ð this has been fixed by constant score rewriting in these queries.
