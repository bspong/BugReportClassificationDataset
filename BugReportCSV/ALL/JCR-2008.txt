System search manager uses a SessionItemStateManager
As noted in JCR-2000 the system search manager responsible for indexing the jcr system subtree uses the SessionItemStateManager instance of the system session instead of the SharedItemStateManager of the underlying default workspace. This can cause a deadlock see the thread dumps in JCR-2000 when one thread is accessing the LockManager that also uses the system session while another thread is persisting versioning changes. See the search-on-sism.patch attachment in JCR-2000 for a fix to this issue.Patch applied in revision 750437. Merged to the 1.5 branch in revision 750439.
