MSSqlFileSystem - JNDI several configuration issues
there are several configuration issues using the org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.db.MSSqlFileSystem my working configuration repository.xml looks like FileSystem class org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.db.MSSqlFileSystem Ê param name driver value javax.naming.InitialContext Ê param name url value java MYDatasource Ê param name schema value mssql Ê param name schemaObjectPrefix value MYPREFIX Ê param name user value MYUSERNAME Ê param name password value MYPASSWORD Ê param name tableSpace value FileSystem i have to unnecessarily specify username password because the MSSqlFileSystem presets them to an empty string instead of null. funnily enough the tableSpace is preset to null which leads to a nullpointer in createSchemaSql Good point Attached patch fixes this for both the MSSqlFileSystem and the DB2FileSystem.Thanks for the patch It looks good I will commit it to the trunk.Hi Martijn Sorry I didn t see your comment only An unknown error occured ... of course you commit the patch - Regards Thomas No problem - . Committed in revision 800715. Merged to the 1.x branch in revision 801116.
