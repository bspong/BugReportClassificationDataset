Move to the new URIUtil class
Depricate httpclient.URIUtil class and methods Move all URIUtil calls to httpclient.util.URIUtil Actually the encode xxx charset methods are not required... Because it s strongly recommended to use UTF-8 as the charset for the protocols. and it s default. And I added the getQeury method. But I provided those methods for the fuctionality compatiblity. There are methods for bytes they really doesn t required. It was designed to deal with byte unit processing... But now the URI class solve all of them... If there is the need to convert space to plus perhaps that could be implemented. But that s not really URI specification... and for that kinda www- form-urlencoded it s recommend for you use java.net.URLEncoder. BTW I recommend you to use directly HttpURL or HttpsURL classes rather than URIUtil. You will find the usefulness.
