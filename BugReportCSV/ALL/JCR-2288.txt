o.a.jackrabbit.spi.commons.conversion.NameParser should not assume that namespace URI s are registered
according to JCR 2.0 3.4.3.4 Parsing Lexical Paths quote An otherwise valid path containing an expanded name with an unregistered namespace URI will always resolve into a valid internal representation of a path quote the current implementation assumes that namespace URIs encountered in expanded form names are registered otherwise the name is treated as qualified name.i consider this to be part of JCR-1564 which should address the modified more flexiable namespace handling.the current NameParser implementation depends on the namespace registry and therefore causes unneccessary server-roundtrips in certain setups scenarios. i consider this to be part of JCR-1564 which should address the modified more flexiable namespace handling. i don t agree. NameParser should IMO not rely on the namespace registry static analysis should be sufficient see also JCR-2275 .Fixed in revision 815745. URI prefixes of the form and x y and internal for Jackrabbit compatibility are now accepted as valid without further namespace checks. This follows the name parsing rules from JCR 2.0 and the relaxed namespace handling mechanism adopted in JCR-1564. The following corner cases had to be adjusted prefix name no longer maps to prefix name but to prefix name jackrabbit abc is no longer a valid name regardless of namespace mappings abc is now a valid local name
