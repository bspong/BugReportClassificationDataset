Make the Payload Boosting Queries consistent
BoostingFunctionTermQuery should be consistent with BoostingNearQuery - Renaming to PayloadNearQuery and PayloadTermQuery This is what I would do - merge boostingfunctiontermquery into boostingtermquery and consolidate the tests lots of dupe removed that way back into one file. I want to remove PayloadQuery marking interface as well - why do we have it If no one objects to this patch I m going to commit it - and I m tempted to remove the PayloadQuery marker as well unless someone can tell me why how you might use it. I ll commit this later today For the record see discussion at http www.lucidimagination.com search document 391bcc3d240e43a3 boostingnearquery 5881f05ebe7c4497 rename to PayloadNearQuery and PayloadTermQuery I m going to commit this one soon so that I can adjust the clone patch to work with this rename. r806894
