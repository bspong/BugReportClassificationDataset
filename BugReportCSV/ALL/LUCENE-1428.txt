Highlighter dist jar includes memory binary class files
Mark Harwood sent me a note about this issue noticed by a colleague. Previous releases have the memory class files in the Highlighter distribution jar. The Highlighter uses the same contrib dependency method that the xml query parser does - the problem doesn t manifest there because of the alphabetical order of build though. Fix is to not inheritAll when launching the ant task to build memory contrib. Thanks Mark and Mark and colleague I just committed this.
