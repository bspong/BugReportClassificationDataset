remove IndexSearcher.close
Now that IS is never heavy since you have to pass in your own IR IS.close is truly a no-op... I think we should remove it. 1 here s a patch... some tests are angry about what i did in LuceneTestCase though. updated patch all tests pass. I would like to commit soon so the patch does not grow out of date. The fix for the readerFinishedLister is cool as the listener gets called for a lot of readers also those closed during reopen... remove 3.6 tag from Fix Version s Should not have been marked for 3.6... in 3.6 you can still open an IndexSearcher over a Directory and it manages the Reader instance in that case so you should call close . I started trying to backport test fixes but i found 3.x s tests are massively out of sync with trunk mostly using tons of deprecated APIs. I ll try to see if i can sync up the tests a bit otherwise backporting in general is going to get difficult.
