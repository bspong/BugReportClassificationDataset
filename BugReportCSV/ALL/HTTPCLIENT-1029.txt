Update 3.x legacy homepage with end of life notification and pointer to HTTPComponents
If you google for http client or httpclient or apache http client the first result is always legacy Commons-HttpClient page. If you follow the link there s no indication whatsoever on the legacy page that its not the latest version or that it s end-of-lifed. Unless you re already aware of HttpComponents there s no obvious way to find it from the legacy page. The only reference to HttpComponents is actually in the History section. The source for the legacy page should be updated to indicate Commons-HttpClient is an end-of-lifed project and should provide a pointer to the new HttpComponents page in a more prominent location.Hi Brad I am aware of the situation. HttpClient 3.1 will be officially declared end of life at the same time with the 4.1 final release. I am going to update the legacy web site shortly after. HttpClient 4.1 final is planned for early Q1 2011. OlegOld web site moved to http hc.apache.org httpclient-legacy . EOL notice added to features index news overview and userguide pages. Oleg
