NullPointerException in VirtualNodeTypeStateManager.nodeTypeRegistered
I am working on a custom persistence manager which requires an additional node type being registered. For performance reasons the existence of this node type is verified during PersistenceManager.init. Unfortunately this does not seem to work as the VirtualNodeTypeStateManager is not prepared to handle this situation at that point in time - the systemSession field seems to still be null.why using the VirtualNodeTypeStateManager and not directly use the nodetype registry this can be aquired using the PMContext.getNodeTypeRegistry Actually I do not care for the VirtualNodeTypeStateManager but this is called when I register a new node type through the NodeType registry from the PMContext.Author tripod Date Wed Oct 12 02 14 21 2005 New Revision 314832 URL http svn.apache.org viewcvs rev 314832 view rev Log JCR-251 NullPointerException in VirtualNodeTypeStateManager.nodeTypeRegistered Modified    incubator jackrabbit trunk src java org apache jackrabbit core nodetype virtual VirtualNodeTypeStateManager.java
