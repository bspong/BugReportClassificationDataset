Wrong schemaObjectPrefix parameter in default repository.xml
The object schema prefix is hard-coded in the default configuration file I think this taken from the jackrabbit-core.jar          PersistenceManager class org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.bundle.DerbyPersistenceManager            param name url value jdbc derby wsp.home db create true            param name schemaObjectPrefix value Jackrabbit Core          PersistenceManager This is probably caused by JCR-945 though I ve no idea why wsp.name is replaced with the name of the module... I have marked this issue as minor because it still works with the DerbyPersistenceManager. There are separate database instances for each workspace but it will become a problem if a data base persistence manager on a dedicated server is used.This seems to be related to http jira.codehaus.org browse MRESOURCES-3. The report is pretty confusing and the resolution does not say in what version the fix is.We should probably disable filtering for most parts of src main resources.The only workaround I see is - move the repository.properties to a separate resources-filtered folder - change the pom.xml Index pom.xml pom.xml revision 610328 pom.xml working copy -230 6 230 9       resources         resource           directory src main resources directory resource resource directory src main resources-filtered directory           filtering true filtering         resource       resources Does anyone have a better idea Jukka wrote We should probably disable filtering for most parts of src main resources. to my knowledge you can not selectively filter except when using separate resource directories. see previous comment.The resources-filtered idea seems OK to me.Fixed in trunk 610372 and 1.4 branch 610377 .
