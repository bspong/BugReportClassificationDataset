msoffice text extractor for office 2007 files
i created a patch that provides a mstextextractor for jackrabbit. this patch will entirely replace all existing ms extractors. this patch can be applied as soon as poi-3.5 is available. the ms text extractor supports doc docx ppt pptx xls xlsx. the patch is not fully tested and uses poi code which is not yet available on the maven repo needs to be build locally Thanks I applied the patch in revision 762789. I also upgraded the POI dependency to the latest 3.5-beta5 version. PS. Note that the new POI libraries require Java 5.Targeting this for Jackrabbit 2.0 to avoid problems with the Java 5 requirement.
