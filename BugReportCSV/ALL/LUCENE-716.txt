Support unicode escapes in QueryParser
As suggested by Yonik in http issues.apache.org jira browse LUCENE-573 the QueryParser should be able to handle unicode escapes i. e. uXXXX. I have already working and tested code. It is based on the patch i submitted for LUCENE-573 so once this is hopefully committed I will submit another patch here. I attach the patch file that adds the ability to handle unicode escapes to the QueryParser as well as new tests to TestQueryParser. The tests pass. Committed. Thanks again Michael
