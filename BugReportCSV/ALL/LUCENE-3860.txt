3.x indexes have the wrong normType set in fieldinfos
3.x codec claims the single byte norms are BYTES VAR STRAIGHT in FieldInfos but the norms implementation itself then has the type as FIXED INTS 8. patch adding a verification to CheckIndex TestBackwardsCompatibility then fails without the fix and fixing the bug. I want to get this bugfix in then see if we can factor out current logic in testDocValues testFieldNorms into a combined checkDocValues that both of these use. I think it just needs to take as parameters the expected Type etc from FieldInfos and the expected size docs etc etc. factoring out the checkindex tests r1299382 was easy and did not yield any surprises... at least yet.
