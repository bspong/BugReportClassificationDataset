David Spencer Spell Checker improved
hy i developed a SpellChecker based on the David Spencer code DSc but more flexible. the structure of the index is inspired of the DSc for a 3-4 gram word gram3 gram4 3start 4start .. 3end 4end .. transposition This index is a dictonary so there isn t the freq field like with DSc version. it s independant of the user index. So we can add words becoming to several fields of several index for example or why not to a file with a list of words. The suggestSimilar method return a list of suggests word sorted by the Levenshtein distance and optionaly to the popularity of the word for a specific field in a user index. More of that this list can be restricted only to words present in a specific field of a user index. See the test case. i hope this code will be put in the lucene sandbox. Nicolas Maisonneuve Created an attachment id 13009 the source It looks like this has actually been in CVS SVN since 2004 so I m closing this. Thanks Nicolas. Done a while back. Not not sure this is the right way of proceeding with JIRA. Should I open a new bug report instead of commenting This implementation as of Lucene 1.9.1 uses an un-optimized implementation of the Levenshtein Distance algorithm it uses way too much memory . Please see Bug 38911 http issues.apache.org bugzilla show bug.cgi id 38911 for more information and the new implementation. Hi CŽdrik. Yes please open a new issue and attach the patch if you have it. It looks like this would create a commons-lang dependency in which case the build script for the spell checker might need a small tweak too.
