 OCM rename o.a.j.ocm.persistence.PersistenceManager to avoid confusion with core component
PersistenceManager is a well known and established interface in jackrabbit s architecture. the same-named class in the jcr-mapping contrib project should IMO be renamed in order to avoid confusion in mailing list threads and jira issues Why not ObjectManager ObjectManager is perhaps too generic how about e.g. ObjectStore I prefer something like ObjectContentManager or ObjectManager.Done - now dates are not converted in long if UtilDateConverterImpl is used. XPath query seems to work with dates.Ooops forget the last comment. It was an error Sorry. I prefer something like ObjectContentManager or ObjectManager. 1The code has been changed. the PersistenceManager has been renamed into ObjectContentManager The xdoc still contains some references to the PersistenceManager name but I m going to review the ocm doc during the summer.
