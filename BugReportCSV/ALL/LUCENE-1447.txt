Improve payload error handling reporting
If you try to load a payload more than once you get the exception IOException Payload cannot be loaded more than once for the same term position. You also get this exception if their is no payload to load and its a bit confusing as the message doesn t relate to the actual problem. Not sure whats best here but I don t like the idea of adding another variable just to know which case the error is. So how about just changing the message to alert you that either case could be the problem Committed revision 714231. Thanks Mark
