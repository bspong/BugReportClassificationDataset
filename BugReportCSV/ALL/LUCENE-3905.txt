BaseTokenStreamTestCase should test analyzers on real-ish content
We already have LineFileDocs that pulls content generated from europarl or wikipedia... I think sometimes BTSTC should test the analyzers on that as well. Patch. I also fixed end offset bug in the ngram tokenizers... 1 we know the ngramtokenizers truncate to the first 1024 chars but that doesn t mean they can t implement end correctly so that at least highlighting on multivalued fields etc works. oh one thing i think we should blast the filter versions of these the same way e.g. if i have mocktokenizer edge ngramfilter are they ok The ngram filters are unfortunately not OK they use up tons of RAM when you send random big tokens through them because they don t have the same 1024 character limit... I think we should open a new issue for them... in fact I think repairing them could make a good GSoC I see... well 1 for this commit its an improvement OK I opened LUCENE-3907 for ngram love...
