Incorrect check for replace when importing item with colliding id
When fixing JCR-1128 bug was introduced due to incorrect check for UUID behavior. Current code is 201 if existing.getId .equals id 202 uuidBehavior ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT UUID COLLISION REMOVE EXISTING 203 uuidBehavior ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT UUID COLLISION REMOVE EXISTING 204 throw new ItemExistsException existing.safeGetJCRPath 205 While it should check for ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT UUID COLLISION REPLACE EXISTING in one of the cases line 202 or 203 . Also it is possible that id of imported item is not known and therefore value of id variable is null and check will always fail. Would be nice if this case can be handled as well. fixed in r643919 as suggested. thanks for reporting this issue Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 650343.
