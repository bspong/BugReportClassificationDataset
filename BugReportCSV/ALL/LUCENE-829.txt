StandardBenchmarker makeDocument does not explicitly close opened files
StandardBenchmarker makeDocument File in String tags boolean stored boolean tokenized boolean tfv BufferedReader reader new BufferedReader new FileReader in Above reader is not closed until GC hits it. Can cause problems in cases where ulimit is set too low. I did this while line reader.readLine null body.append line .append reader.close This is also true for ReutersDocMaker StringBuffer bodyBuf new StringBuffer 1024 while line reader.readLine null bodyBuf.append line .append reader.close Commited the fix for this. There were actually two more cases like this. Thanks Karl Patch commited already attaching it here for any future reference purposes.
