Add a serializing content handler
Both JCR-1310 and JCR-1343 need XML serialization functionality and we ve also previously JCR-367 JCR-1086 implemented something similar. It would be good to centralize such code and so I d like to use the already referenced code from Cocoon 1 as the basis for a SerializingContentHandler class in jackrabbit-jcr-commons. 1 https svn.apache.org repos asf cocoon trunk core cocoon-pipeline cocoon-pipeline-impl src main java org apache cocoon serialization AbstractTextSerializer.javaResolved in revision 616030.Scheduling for commons 1.4.1 releaseMerged into 1.4 branch for commons 1.4.1 release in Rev. 641282.Closing issues has been released in jackrabbit-jcr-commons 1.4.2Using SerializingContentHandler in jcr2spi as of revision 659085.
