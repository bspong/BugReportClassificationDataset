Demo HTML parser doesn t work for international documents
Javacc assumes ASCII so it won t work with say japanese documents. Ideally it would read the charset from the HTML markup but that can by tricky. For now assuming unicode would do the trick Add the following line marked with a to HTMLParser.jj options STATIC false OPTIMIZE TOKEN MANAGER true DEBUG LOOKAHEAD true DEBUG TOKEN MANAGER true UNICODE INPUT true Decrease priority mark as improvement since it only affects demo. Also I m not sure we need to support other languages as this code should not be used in production anyway. attached is a patch it also fixes LUCENE-2246.
