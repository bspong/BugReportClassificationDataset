Unnecessary parameter in NodeTypeRegistry.persistCustomNodeTypeDefs NodeTypeDefStore store 
The parameter store is not used within this method. I suggest to delete the parameter to make the code more readable. This patch removes the parameter store from method persistCustomNodeTypeDefs in class NodeTypeRegistry and in calls to this method from within the class NodeTypeRegistry.persistCustomNodeTypeDefs NodeTypeDefStore store is protected i.e. it might be used by subclasses. rather than removing the store parameter i changed the implementation to that effect that it now makes use of it.
