Make QueryAutoStopWordAnalyzer immutable and reusable
Currently QueryAutoStopWordAnalyzer allows its list of stop words to be changed after instantiation through its addStopWords methods. This stops the Analyzer from being reusable since it must instantiate its StopFilters every time. Having these methods means that although the Analyzer can be instantiated once and reused between IndexReaders the actual analysis stack is not reusable which is probably the more expensive part . So lets change the Analyzer so that its stop words are set at instantiation time facilitating reuse. Patch against trunk no deprecations . All functionality is moved to constructors. Tests are cleaned up and renamed. Will make a 3x patch with deprecations. Patch for 3x with deprecations. 3x Committed revision 1170423. Trunk Committed revision 1170424. I will tackle proper reusability along with the other remaining Analyzers. Bulk close after release of 3.5
