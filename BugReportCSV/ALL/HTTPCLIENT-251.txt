Content-Length Transfer-Encoding request headers should be handled by entity enclosing methods
Currently Content-Length Transfer-Encoding request headers are handled by the HttpMethodBase class. This is conceptually wrong and error-prone in my opinion. Entity enclosing methods should control Content-Length Transfer- Encoding request headers instead as they provide request content and encapsulate the requisite content transfer logic.Created an attachment id 7507 Patch take 1 Looks good to me except for one minor Javadoc item. EntityEnclosingMethod.getRequestContentLength currently references the removed method in HttpMethodBase. MikeCreated an attachment id 7512 Patch take 2 Javadoc warning corrected.
