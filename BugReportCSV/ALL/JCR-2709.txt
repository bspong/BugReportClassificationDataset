Missing XPath escape in query.jsp
As reported by Canberk Bolat of ADEO Security in a private communication there search.jsp script in jackrabbit-webapp is missing an escape when it injects the path of a related query into the constructed XPath statement. Further analysis showed that this issue has no security implications so we can treat this as a normal bug report. search.jsp ... String q request.getParameter q ...       if q null q.length 0            String stmt            if q.startsWith related                String path q.substring related .length                stmt element nt file rep similar jcr content path jcr content rep excerpt . order by jcr score descending                queryTerms similar to b Text.encodeIllegalXMLCharacters path b             ... Patch to fix the issue. Escapes single quotes that may be present in a path to generate the related queryThanks Fixed in revision 1038657.
