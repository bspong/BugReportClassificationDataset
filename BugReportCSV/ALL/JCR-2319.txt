jackrabbit-jcr-client should put all test data under . target
Currently the jackrabbit-jcr-client component drops a repository directory and the repository.xml and derby.log files into the project root when running the test suite. These files should go inside target .I suggest to add workingDirectory target workingDirectory to the surefire plugin configuration thus using the target directory as the current directory for the test runs.I just tried to set the working directory in code. That is set the user.dir property in the setup method and reset it to its initial value in the teardown method. However I seem to be hitting http bugs.sun.com bugdatabase view bug.do 3B YfiG bug id 4117557 here. The files are being created at the wrong location. I therefor suggest to go with my initial proposal and set the working directory of the surefire plugin. Fixed in revision 818423
