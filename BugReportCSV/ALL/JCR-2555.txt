Improved reusability of the JCA package
The jackrabbit-jca package currently has hardcoded references to jackrabbit-core which makes it difficult to reuse the packaging and related code with other JCR implementations. With the RepositoryFactory interface from JCR 2.0 we can avoid this hard dependency.The JCA package now supports a RepositoryURI parameter that can be used to connect to any JCR repository that supports the JcrUtils.getRepository conventions.
