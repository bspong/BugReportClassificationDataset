Add Highlighting benchmark support to contrib benchmark
I would like to be able to test the performance speed initially of the Highlighter in a standard way. Patch to follow that adds the Highlighter as a dependency benchmark and adds in tasks extending the ReadTask to perform highlighting on retrieved documents. First draft of adding highlighter support to benchmarker. Also fixes minor nit bug LUCENE-1129 Note this patch also assumes LUCENE-1127 has been applied and built. Patch does not work with term.vectors true at the moment. Am working to resolve. Task now requires docs to be stored either for analyzing the text or at least for having text to highlight in the first place . Added some more unit tests. Still requires the LUCENE-1127 patch and also fixes LUCENE-1129. Also adds in a couple of sample alg files to demonstrate using it. I ll commit after the release. Is it just me or does this patch seem to assume that a couple of new classes already exist If so any chance of getting a clean one I think this one is good. I have noticed w SVN that I was getting things like this from svn stat A src java org apache lucene benchmark byTask tasks SearchTravRetHighlightTask.java Which means that SVN thinks there is a history for the file. Turns out it is from doing a copy of another file. Thus I had to remove the file and then readd it. Committed on rev 614885
