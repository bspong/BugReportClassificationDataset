IndexWriter.setMaxMergeDocs gives non-backwards-compatible exception out of the box 
Yonik hit this see details in LUCENE-994 because we have switched to LogByteSizeMergePolicy by default in IndexWriter which uses MB to limit max size of merges setMaxMergeMB when an existing app calls setMaxMergeDocs or getMaxMergeDocs it will hit an IllegalArgumentException on dropping in the new JAR. I think the simplest solution is to fix LogByteSizeMergePolicy to allow setting of the max by either MB or by doc count just like how in LUCENE-1007 allows flushing by either MB or docCount or both. fix LogByteSizeMergePolicy to allow setting of the max by either MB or by doc count 1 Attached patch to move setMaxMergeDocs up into LogMergePolicy so that IndexWriter.setMaxMergeDocs ... works out-of-the-box again. I plan to commit in a few days. I just committed this.
