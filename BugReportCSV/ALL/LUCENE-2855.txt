Contrib queryparser should not use CharSequence as Map key
Today contrib query parser uses Map CharSequence ... in many different places which may lead to problems since CharSequence interface does not enforce the implementation of hashcode and equals methods. Today it s causing a problem with QueryTreeBuilder.setBuilder CharSequence QueryBuilder method that does not works as expected. Here is the fix for the problem raised at thread 1 . The patch also includes a junit to make sure the problem doesn t show up again. If there are no concerns in two days I will go ahead and commit the patch. 1 - http lucene.markmail.org thread mbb5wlxttsa6sges 1 to commit. In general one should never use interfaces as keys in maps as long as they don t declare the equals and hashcode methods inside the interface . One thing in your patch Lucene tests should always extend LuceneTestCase which is Junit4 1 - just put your name after the description in the changes.txt Thanks for pointing out the problems here is the new patch patch applied on revision 1057454
