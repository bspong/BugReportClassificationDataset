Allow storing user data when IndexWriter.commit is called
Spinoff from here http www.mail-archive.com java-user lucene.apache.org msg22303.html The idea is to allow optionally passing an opaque String commitUserData to the IndexWriter.commit method. This String would be stored in the segments N file and would be retrievable by an IndexReader. Applications could then use this to assign meaning to each commit. It would be nice to get this done for 2.4 but I don t think we should hold the release for it. Hi Mike If you add this feature I suggest you clearly document its purpose. Writing a short comment in the segments file can be useful when utmost performance is needed e.g. like when you just want to check if you want to reopen or not but my guess is that for most other scenarios there s an alternative in the existing Lucene. I.e. one possible way to achieve almost the same goal but without changing anything in the code is to put a special document in the index - e.g. imagine you put a document with some unique searchable field term combination just to find this document and a stored field with your userdata . Before doing the next commit just update i.e. delete and add this document to a new value and commit . This method is not as super-quick as the one you proposed but I think that for most uses it is quick enough and more versatile. For example what happens with the proposed feature if the code that needs to write this user data is in a library which cannot control exactly the commit times And what happen if several different libraries or code modules want to write their own different commit user data With the simple alternative method I mentioned you have 1. several commit user data s can exist by using different field term to find them 2. a library can put the commit user data to the index and have it take effect on the next commit rather than needing to specify it in the commit call . 3. an extra commit call does not delete the previously set data I m not sure what you intend to do in this case in your suggestion . I guess that it wouldn t hurt to add the feature that you propose - I just hope that people don t start using it for things that established Lucene mechanisms like documents would have been better. I feel uncomfortable with the suggestion of inserting fake documents for the reasons outlined here http www.mail-archive.com java-user lucene.apache.org msg22294.html It seems like there is a place for both approaches since they have different tradeoffs I plan to add a static IndexReader method much like eg getVersion that lets you retrieve the commitUserData of the current segments N file. So you re right this enables fast checking of the latest commitUserData in the index. I was thinking it s a single String and if you set it by calling commit commitUserData and the commit completes successfully it overwrites whatever was there previously. Attached patch. I think we should not rush this into 2.4 so I ll wait to commit to trunk until after we ve branched.
