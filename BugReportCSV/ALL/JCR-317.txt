replace UUID strings by UUID classes in NodeId etc..
Currently the UUIDs of the nodes are stored as Strings in the ItemIds and ItemStates and cause alot of overhead throughout jackrabbit. they should be replaced by a fast implementation of a UUID class.- replaced all usages of String uuid by NodeId - replaced the uuids in the child node entries by NodeId - replaced parentUUID of the item state by NodeId - contructors of the ItemState now take ItemIds - added NodeState.getNodeId - added PropertyState.getPropertyId fixed in revision 378221
