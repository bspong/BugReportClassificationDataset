RMI Property.getValue fails with EOFException after many reads
When reading binary properties via RMI it can happen that it fails throwing an EOFException. This is caused by a server sided Too many open files bacause BinaryValue.writeObject does not close the underlying value InputStream.fixed. Committed revision 483415. Ah correct Thanks for the fix. In fact I should probaly look at refactoring the entire BinaryValue implementation in JCR-RMI as the current implementation gets the stream consumed when the instance is serialized. For now it s no problem since the Value instance is only used for a single serialization but this might turn out to cause trouble later on. PS. When resolving issues please only Resolve it and do not Close it. This makes it possible to edit the issue metadata when preparing a release for example I d set the fields for versions affected and fixed . The issue should only be Closed when it goes out in an official release to signify that there will be no more changes to that issue. See my recent Jira guidelines message to dev .
