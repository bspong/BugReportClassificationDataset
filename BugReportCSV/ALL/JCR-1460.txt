Typo in repository.xml
The extractorPoolSize parameter name has a trailing white space which makes jackrabbit ignore it.Fixed in trunk 634604 and 1.4 branch 634605 .Why not make the config parser trim all parameter names to be resistent against such typos I cannot imagine a parameter name to include leading or trailing spaces that would be bad usability. Not talking about values here they sure might need whitespace.And what about throwing an exception on error Why not make the config parser trim all parameter names to be resistent against such typos I wanted to keep the fix as small as possible because I also wanted to apply it to the branch. And what about throwing an exception on error That s a different discussion please open a new jira issue.Yeah both ideas are worth separate Jira issues. Patches welcome. - There s a second instance in repository.xml that needs to be fixed. A new ticket was opened JCRF-1503 .
