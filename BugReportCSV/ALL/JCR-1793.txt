Namespace handling in AbstractSession should be synchronized
The AbstractSession base class in o.a.j.commons implicitly assume that the session is never accessed concurrently from more than one thread and thus doesn t synchronize access to the namespace map. This causes problems when the session is accessed concurrently. Instead of relying on client code we should enforce thread-safety by explicitly synchronizing potentially unsafe operations on the session instance.Limited the scope of this issue to cover only namespace handling in AbstractSession. Let s cover the larger topic of sessions vs. threads in another issue.Resolved in revisions 704002 and 704005. Merged to the 1.5 branch.
