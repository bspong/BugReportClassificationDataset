New tool for reseting the length norm of fields after changing Similarity
I ve written a little tool that seems like it can will be very handy as I tweak my custom similarity. I think it would make a good addition to contrib miscellaneous. Class and Tests to be attached shortly... Class with utility function and main that calls it on an FSDirectory. Also test cases for the utility function using a RAMDirectory Looks good Should this be in the index package You could even optionally reconstruct the boost if you wanted to to the precision allowed by the 8 bit float at least by using the original Similarity to calculate what the lengthNorm is alone and comparing against the actual norm. FYI I picked the package to match the other classes in contrib miscellaneous ... I don t think it matters very much what package it lives in. As for reconstructing the boost It s possible but this met my needs and I ve got some bigger things to worry about at the moment. Commited with some small documentation additions.
