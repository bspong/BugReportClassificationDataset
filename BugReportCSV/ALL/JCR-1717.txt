Configure occurrence of property value in excerpt
Jackrabbit currently includes all indexed property values as potential content in an excerpt. This is not always desirable because there may be properties that need to be full-text indexed but should not show up in an excerpt.Implemented in revision 684732 See documentation on http wiki.apache.org jackrabbit IndexingConfiguration
