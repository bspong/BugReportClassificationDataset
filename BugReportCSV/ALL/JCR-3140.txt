Add configurable hook for password validation
it s a common use case that applications would like to enforce additional logic associated with changing a user password. currently this can only be achieved by using a derived user implementation. by extending the functionality added with JCR-3118 it was fairly trivial to provide a hook for those custom password validation checks writing password expiration date etc.etc. slightly redefined the authorizableaction interface. it now covers the following user group operations - createUser - createGroup - remove authorizable - changePassword jackrabbit-core currently provides the following example implementations - ClearMembership removes group membership before removing an authorizable - AccessControl upon creation sets up permissions for a new user group on the corresponding node configurable set of privileges for users and groups - PasswordValidation simple password validation upon createUser and changePassword based on a configured regexp. the desired set of validation actions needs to be configured with the UserManagement section in the security configuration by optionally adding one or multiple AuthorizableAction class elements. the actions will be called according to the order within the configuration.
