Implement jcr-jackrabbit ... repository URIs
The current file ... URIs used by the Jackrabbit RepositoryFactoryImpl class make it hard to support extra parameters and prevent other JCR implementations from using similar repository URI patterns. Thus I propose that we start supporting a jcr-jackrabbit ... URI pattern in addition to the current file ... pattern.Jackrabbit now supports repository URIs of the form jcr-jackrabbit path to repository. Additional repository configuration parameters can be included as query parameters in the URI.
