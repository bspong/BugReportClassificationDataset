Show referencing nodes in debug log when trying to delete a node with references
This can be very useful when trying to analyze errors from non-interactive applications in a production environment.i d prefer that the property id s are only included in the debug msg not in the exception msg i.e. if log.isDebugEnabled   ... Committed with modifications in revision 1130192 and merged to the 2.2 branch in revision 1130194. Agreed with Stefan about not including the references in the exception message. In the extreme case doing so could even expose information that s hidden by access control. I modified the patch to only include the list of references in the logged debug message.
