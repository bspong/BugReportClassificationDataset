XPath parser ignores parent axis
The query handler in Jackrabbit does not support the parent axis and should throw an invalid query exception in that case. Example query foo ..Fixed in revision 500298Marked this as a bug. A new feature would be to actually support the parent axis.I switched to JackRabbit 1.3 but I still have the problem. My Query looks like node .. Is 1.3 build after 500298 Please note that the fix for this issue was to throw an exception if the statement uses the parent axis javax.jcr.query.InvalidQueryException Parent axis is not supported If you want jackrabbit to actually support the parent axis please create a new issue.
