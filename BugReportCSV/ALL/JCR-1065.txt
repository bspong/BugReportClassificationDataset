Workspace Copy Move VersionableTest assumptions on versioning
These test cases assume that an ancestor of a versioned node can be made versioned. This may not be true for all JCR compliant stores. There should be a way to skip the test when it can not be executed. One obvious approach would be to throw a NotExecutableException when the attempt to enable versioning on the parent fails. However this has the drawback that it can mask configuration errors. Thoughts Sounds reasonable. Sounds reasonable to throw the exception or to try something else - The obvious approach to throw a NotExecutableException sounds reasonable to me. Should have been more precise...Fixed as discussed with revision 567054. Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 577851.
