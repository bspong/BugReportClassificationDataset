setProperty name new Value 0 PropertyType.LONG loses property type
Adding an empty multivalued property with a specific non-STRING type to an unstructured node i.e. one with an UNDEFINED multivalued property definition creates an empty multivalued property of type STRING. In some cases keeping the explicit type information is important so we should avoid losing it.Fixed in revision 628156 merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 628159.
