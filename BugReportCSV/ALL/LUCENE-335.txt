Testcase for StandardAnalyzer
As per our discussion on lucene-user I m attaching a unit test for StandardAnalyzer. I wrote most of the tests from reading the comments in the StandardTokenizer.jj grammar. Someone familiar with the grammar and its intent should review the tests. Created an attachment id 14030 JUnit test case for StandardAnalyzer Thanks This has been committed.
