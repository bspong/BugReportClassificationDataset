QOM to SQL2 doesn t cast numeric literals
SQL2 statements generated by the QueryObjectModel.getStatement don t contain CAST ... AS ... for numeric literals of types DECIMAL DOUBLE and LONG. The type information is lost which can result in incorrect query results depending on the query engine if the generated SQL2 statement is executed.Should be fixed in the 2.2 branch as well.
