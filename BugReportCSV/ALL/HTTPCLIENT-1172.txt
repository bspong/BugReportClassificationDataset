LocalTestServer and supporting classes should be available as a separate jar
LocalTestServer and it s supporting classes are useful to anyone who wants to easily mock test simple http calls without having to embed a full jetty or something. It would be awesome if these were available in a separate http-localtestserver.jar that could be used in projects outside of httpclient.HttpClient testing framework is already available as a Maven artifact.      dependency        groupId org.apache.httpcomponents groupId        artifactId httpclient artifactId        version 4.1.3 version        scope test scope        classifier tests classifier LocalTestServer is actually nothing more than a very thin wrapper around server-side HttpCore. What is the reason for not using HttpCore directly OlegBecause then I would have to write a very thin wrapper around server-side HttpCore for each project I wanted to use it in. Since that s already done I thought it would be easier to just reuse the local server wrapper already writtenNothing would prevent you from reusing your code across multiple projects I guess. Anyway I do not see a problem with packaging a few classes into a separate jar. Please let me know what classes or packages you would like to be included in that artifact. OlegI am closing this issue as FIXED assuming that already publidshed test jar is good enough. If you want local test server packaged as a separate artifect please let me know what classes packages should be included. Oleg
