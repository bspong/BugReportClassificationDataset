 PATCH jackrabbit-webapp pom.xml patch to create an additional jar artifact
Modifies the jackrabbit-webapp pom.xml to create a jar artifact in addition to the existing war artifact to allow the jackrabbit-webapp utility servlets to be reused in other modules. The right way would be to create a separate jar module for the servlets or move them to jackrabbit-jcr-commons and reuse that jar as a dependency in the jackrabbit-webapp. So I m not sure if this patch deserves to be applied to the trunk but it can be useful as a workaround before a cleaner solution is implemented. See also http mail-archives.apache.org mod mbox jackrabbit-dev 200705.mbox 3C510143ac0705151453t7a0eb4cam859a40fb106e81f5 mail.gmail.com 3E which discusses possible improvements to these jackrabbit-webapp utility servlets. Thanks Patch applied in revision 543651. I won t tag this for any future release as I d like to create a more reusable set of servlet components for this need. See JCR-956 for the more general issue. Once we have something like that I think we can revert this change.Contrary to my comment above this change did go to 1.4 so I m correcting the version tagging. There are cases where having the jar artifact available is useful even now that we have jackrabbit-jcr-servlet so let s keep this.
