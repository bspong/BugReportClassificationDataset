Move to a newer vesion of Commons Collections
It would be useful if the developer wants to use jackrabbit in an application that uses a newer version of this library.I ran the tests and it seems there s nothing broken. collections was refactored between 2.x and 3.x and many classes were moved to new packages. If you think it s worth the change I volunteer to update the imports.Is there some added benefit in upgrading AFAIK you should be able to just replace the commons-collections 2.1 jar with a newer jar in the classpath if you want to use newer features commons-collections should mostly be backwards compatible . As long as Jackrabbit only specifies the build dependencies and not the runtime dependencies I see this issue as a don t break it if it works case. - But if you think that upgrading the dependency and possibly using the refactored classes would be beneficial also to the Jackrabbit internals then I see no problem in accepting the change. Is there some added benefit in upgrading There are many more features in 3.x that will be available to jackrabbit internals. AFAIK you should be able to just replace the commons-collections 2.1 jar with a newer jar in the classpath yes 3.x is backward compatible but 4.x won t be. I think it s not an important issue now because as you pointed developers can use a newer version without breaking things. I have no strong position on this as long as the newer versions don t break things that s why I created this issue as a minor wish OK sounds reasonable. Unless anyone objects within a week or two I think I can upgrade the dependency. For reference a quick summary of the differences between commons-collections versions http jakarta.apache.org commons collections history.htmlPatch committed in revision 164981. PS. There should be no hurry to update runtime environments that still have commons-collections 2.1 as a dependency. Such an update becomes necessary only if or when new features of 3.1 become used in Jackrabbit.
