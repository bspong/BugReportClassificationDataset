NodeIdImpl is not really serializable
I ve been trying to get jcr2spi - rmi - spi2jcr to work. The error I m seeing is reported as java.io.NotSerializableException org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.commons.identifier.IdFactoryImpl I believe I tracked this down. It is because NodeIdImpl is implicitly referencing its containing instance IdFactoryImpl which is not serializable. NodeIdImpl is attempted to be serialized in my case with the following stack at org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.rmi.client.ClientRepositoryService.getItemInfos ClientRepositoryService.java 258 at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.state.WorkspaceItemStateFactory.createNodeState WorkspaceItemStateFactory.java 94 at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.state.TransientISFactory.createNodeState TransientISFactory.java 99 at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.hierarchy.NodeEntryImpl.doResolve NodeEntryImpl.java 972 at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.hierarchy.HierarchyEntryImpl.resolve HierarchyEntryImpl.java 95 at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.hierarchy.HierarchyEntryImpl.getItemState HierarchyEntryImpl.java 212 at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.ItemManagerImpl.getItem ItemManagerImpl.java 170 at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.SessionImpl.getRootNode SessionImpl.java 216 I think I must be doing something wrong because it seems like this is a fundamental problem with doing jcr2spi - rmi - spi2jcr and looking at the SVN history I don t see how this ever could have worked. So either session.getRootNode has never been tested using jcr2spi - rmi - spi2jcr or I ve got something setup wrong.The following patch fixes the error I was getting and now things appear to work. This patch is a little hacky. It makes all the inner classes static and uses a hack to deal with the getPathFactory instance method that they were using. It used to work initially but when the ItemId implementation stuff was moved to jackrabbit-spi-commons the serialization got broken.- Turned the ItemId implementations into static classes - Added PathFactory parameter to constructors where needed. ItemIds don t need the factory anywhere else. - Added serialVersionUID to NodeIdImpl and PropertyIdImpl - Added test cases that check serializability - Optimized ItemIdImpl.hashCode All tests in jackrabbit trunk ran successfully. I also successfully executed the tests in sandbox spi client against an SPI-RMI server. svn revision 674024 Thank you for reporting this issue.
