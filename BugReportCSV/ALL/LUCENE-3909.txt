Move Kuromoji to analysis.ja and introduce Japanese naming
Lucene Solr 3.6 and 4.0 will get out-of-the-box Japanese language support through KuromojiAnalyzer KuromojiTokenizer and various other filters. These filters currently live in org.apache.lucene.analysis.kuromoji. I m proposing that we move Kuromoji to a new Japanese package org.apache.lucene.analysis.ja in line with how other languages are organized. As part of this I also think we should rename KuromojiAnalyzer to JapaneseAnalyzer etc. to further align naming to our conventions by making it very clear that these analyzers are for Japanese. As much as I like the name Kuromoji I think Japanese is more fitting. A potential issue I see with this that I d like to raise and get feedback on is that end-users in Japan and elsewhere who use lucene-gosen could have issues after an upgrade since lucene-gosen is in fact releasing its analyzers under the org.apache.lucene.analysis.ja namespace and we d have a name clash . I believe users should have the freedom to choose whichever Japanese analyzer filter etc. they d like to use and I don t want to propose a name change that just creates unnecessary problems for users but I think the naming proposed above is most fitting for a Lucene Solr release. 1 1 Thanks Robert and Mike. It would be great to get your feedback on this as well Koji. 1 Hi Christian please go. Thanks Koji. I hope to do the move tomorrow. Committed revision 1305297 to trunk. Backporting to branch 3x. Committed revision 1305367 and 1305372 on branch 3x. I forgot to rename a few Solr test classes. Will follow up now in this JIRA. Committed revision 1305421 on trunk and 1305437 to branch 3x. The move is done. Many thanks to Uwe for pointing out a Java 5 breakage I did Ð and to Robert for fixing it very quickly in revision 1305452 on branch 3x.
