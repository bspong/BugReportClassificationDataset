BooleanQuery.hashCode and equals ignore isCoordDisabled
BooleanQuery.isCoordDisabled is not considered by BooleanQuery s hashCode or equals methods ... this can cause serious badness to happen when caching BooleanQueries. bug traces back to at least 1.9 This is quite nasty. Uwe should we re-spin 3.0 for it Or for 3.0.1 Attached patch... the fix caused TestWildcard.testEmptyTerm to fail so I fixed that too and on back-compat branch. Fixed on trunk... I ll backport to 3.0 once Uwe opens it up... Well if it s been there since 1.9 and this is the first time it s been reported it hasn t caused the world to stop yet. So I don t think it s worth the work unless we have to spin another 3.0 for additional reasons.

I did nt want to have commits in 3.0 because if I respin a release I would not be able to only take some of the fixes into 3.0.0. That was the reason. For now i marked this issue as fix for 3.1 3.0.1 2.9.2 Fixed in trunk 3.0.x branch 2.9.x branch. Thanks Hoss
