remove relative paths assumptions from benchmark code
Also see Eric comments in http www.nabble.com forum ViewPost.jtp post 14347924 framed y Benchmark s config.xml relies on relative paths more or less like this base-dir conf-dir work-dir docs-dir indexes-dir These assumptions are also in the Java code and so it is inconvenient for using absolute paths e.g. for specifying a docs dir that is not under work-dir. Relax this by modifying in build.xml to replace value and line props by location and file and by requiring absolute paths in the Java code. I thought for a moment that with this change we can get rid of all work-dir assumptions and use only absolute paths. But in fact work-dir is necessary to allow running the tests from both trunk home and from benchmark home. So the fix for this issue will not cancel the use of work-dir. Trivial patch for benchmark build.xml. Will commit shortly.
