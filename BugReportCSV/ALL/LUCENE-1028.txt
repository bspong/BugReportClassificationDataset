Weight is not serializable for some of the queries
In order to work with ParallelMultiSearcher Query weights need to be serializable. The interface Weight extends java.io.Serializable but it appears that some of the newer queries unnecessarily store global state in their weights thus causing serialization errors. Thanks for catching this Kyle. Patch looks good to me and working. I enhanced checkQuery in test a.o.l.search.QueryUtils to check all queries for serialization. This catches this bug and verifies the fix. It also shows that BoostingTermQuery fails fr this check but I am not sure why. Correction - BoostingTermQuery is ok but TestBTQ had to be modified for the serialization test to pass. DisjunctionMaxQuery had problems similar to CustomScoreQuery. Updated patch contains Kyle s fixes for search.function weights. serialization test as part of standard queries tests fix for DisjunctionMaxQuery and for few tests. Just committed this fix. Thanks Kyle
