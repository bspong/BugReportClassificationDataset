Make termInfosIndexDivisor configurable
Workspaces with large indexes may consume considerable heap memory. Lucene implements multi level skip lists for terms in the index. The first level of the skip list is kept in memory. This is usually not an issue but when terms consist of long Strings the memory consumption increases drastically. Jackrabbit not just tokenizes string properties but it also creates a single term based on the complete string property value needed for jcr like function . These long terms are the reason for the increased memory consumption.A Lucene IndexReader allows one to set a termInfosIndexDivisor which controls how many terms are loaded into memory. The search index should have a configuration parameter that reflects this property.Added parameter in revision 721470Oops wrong default value... Fixed in revision 723346
