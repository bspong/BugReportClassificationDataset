contrib-spatial java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException on QueryWrapperFilter.getDocIdSet
We use in our Project which is in the devel phase the latest Snapshot release of lucene. After i updated to the latest Snapshot a few days ago one of our JUnit tests fails and throws the following error java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException at org.apache.lucene.search.Query.createWeight Query.java 91 at org.apache.lucene.search.QueryWrapperFilter.getDocIdSet QueryWrapperFilter.java 72 at org.apache.lucene.misc.ChainedFilter.getDISI ChainedFilter.java 150 at org.apache.lucene.misc.ChainedFilter.initialResult ChainedFilter.java 173 at org.apache.lucene.misc.ChainedFilter.getDocIdSet ChainedFilter.java 211 at org.apache.lucene.misc.ChainedFilter.getDocIdSet ChainedFilter.java 141 at org.apache.lucene.search.ConstantScoreQuery ConstantScorer. init ConstantScoreQuery.java 116 at org.apache.lucene.search.ConstantScoreQuery ConstantWeight.scorer ConstantScoreQuery.java 81 at org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search IndexSearcher.java 244 at org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search IndexSearcher.java 172 at org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search Searcher.java 183 at org.hibernate.search.query.QueryHits.updateTopDocs QueryHits.java 100 at org.hibernate.search.query.QueryHits. init QueryHits.java 61 at org.hibernate.search.query.QueryHits. init QueryHits.java 51 at org.hibernate.search.query.FullTextQueryImpl.getQueryHits FullTextQueryImpl.java 373 at org.hibernate.search.query.FullTextQueryImpl.list FullTextQueryImpl.java 293 ... I think it appeared after the Hudson build 917... and the following commit of the Query.java http hudson.zones.apache.org hudson job Lucene-trunk 917 changes detail4 and is in connection with this JIRA issue LUCENE-1771 I hope i m at the right place and that you can fix it. Thanks Thanks Martin Kind of surprised that we don t have a test that would catch this ... It was a mistake in 1771 - queryWeight to createWeight instead of weight - my bad. Here is the patch - I should add a test that catches this as well not in the patch yet . Mark With test case The System.outs should not be there thanks Uwe - will remove and commit shortly. Thanks Martin r805185 No Thank you for the quick fix I didn t expect that you are that fast
