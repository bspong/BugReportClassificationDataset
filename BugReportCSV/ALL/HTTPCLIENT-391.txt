Deprecate and replace TestWebapp with the SimpleHttpServer based testing framework
Basically TestWebapp based testcases test functionality of Tomcat rather than that of HttpClient. They tend to get broken with every major release of Tomcat and have proven more of a burden than any goodRemaining TestWebApp based test cases ported the the SimpleHttpServer based testing framework. TestWebApp servlets delted from SVN trunk. OlegRemoved TestLocalHostBase as well.
