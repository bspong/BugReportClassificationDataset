Remaining contrib testcases should use Version based ctors instead of deprecated ones
Many testcases in contrib use deprecated ctors for WhitespaceTokenizer Analyzer etc. this patch fixes the remaining testcases in contrib. I will hold off with this patch until LUCENE-2055 is committed don t wanna interrupt roberts work with this cleanup here. According to rmuir this will not interrupt LUCENE-2055. Therefore I will commit this is a bit if nobody objects. Committed revision 907034.
