Implement ignoreCookies CookieSpec
It would be useful to Implement an ignoreCookies CookieSpec as was done in Commons HC 3.1 This should be registered by DefaultHttpClient.createCookieSpecRegistry . Patch to follow.Hi Sebastian One can completely disable cookie processing by removing two protocol interceptors from the protocol processing chain RequestAddCookies and ResponseProcessCookies . However if you think availability of ignoreCookies cookie spec would ease migration from 3.1 to 4.x please by all of means go ahead and commit the patch. OlegThanks. Having an ignore option will make it easier for JMeter which currently uses the ignoreSpec to suppress cookie handling I imagine other applications may do the same.
