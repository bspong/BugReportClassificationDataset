Problem with IndexWriter.mergeFinish
I m getting a very infrequent assert in IndexWriter.mergeFinish from TestIndexWriter.testAddIndexOnDiskFull. The problem occurs during the rollback when the merge hasn t been registered. I m not 100 sure this is the correct fix because it s such an infrequent event. final synchronized void mergeFinish MergePolicy.OneMerge merge throws IOException Optimize addIndexes or finishMerges may be waiting on merges to finish. notifyAll if merge.increfDone decrefMergeSegments merge assert merge.registerDone final SegmentInfos sourceSegments merge.segments final int end sourceSegments.size for int i 0 i end i mergingSegments.remove sourceSegments.info i mergingSegments.remove merge.info merge.registerDone false Should be something like final synchronized void mergeFinish MergePolicy.OneMerge merge throws IOException Optimize addIndexes or finishMerges may be waiting on merges to finish. notifyAll if merge.increfDone decrefMergeSegments merge if merge.registerDone final SegmentInfos sourceSegments merge.segments final int end sourceSegments.size for int i 0 i end i mergingSegments.remove sourceSegments.info i mergingSegments.remove merge.info merge.registerDone false I couldn t get the test to fail but I can see one code path if mergeInit hits an exception that would trip the assert incorrectly so I committed that fix. Thanks Scott
