Quick Start guide for HttpClient 4.0
cannot determine the required jar files to compile samples own files example org.apache.http.examples.client.ClientFormLogin used set CLASSPATH P j samples httpClient examples j j j5 h P j e mysql.jar P j e commons-logging-api-1.1.1.jar P j e commons-logging-1.1.1.jar P j e 4 httpmime-4.0-beta2.jar P j e 4 httpclient-4.0-beta2.jar P j e 4 h e 4 httpcore-4.0-beta3.jar P j e 4 httpcore-nio-4.0-beta3.jar but still needs org.apache.http. ... where are these jars a quick start guide link to all jars for one version would help - only known workaround - go back to old version 3.1There is a binary package available at the download page containing all requisite jars. This is a local class loader problem that has nothing to do with HttpClient. Olegthen can you add a page pointing to it - i downloaded all the binaries from http hc.apache.org downloads.cgi did not work out a quick start guide in the samples docs or better yet in the wiki would really helpor at lesat give the exact URL so we can download and use - run the example - org.apache.http.examples.client.ClientFormLoginhttp www.apache.org dist httpcomponents httpclient binary httpcomponents-client-4.0-beta2-bin-with-dependencies.zip Olegthank you much for that. was missing apache-mime4j-0.5.jar now it compiles. would be awesome if you can add this to the samples folder in a read me or and wiki will save time when someone else tries this. i at least had a work around as had a copy working with 3.1 Tushar Kapila http sel2in.com www.worldcommunitygrid.org Volunteer computer Cancer cures www.thehungersite.com and www.bhookh.com feed hungry its free. www.ecologyfund.com Please add these to your start-up how to http tusharkapila.blogspot.com 2008 05 s.htmlFair enough. A Getting Started guide for HttpClient 4.0 would indeed be nice. BTW feel free to contribute OlegI added a page at http wiki.apache.org HttpComponents called quick start though I think this para could be in the downloads page or a link to a seperate page on the home page would be better attached is short html for this - can add to it later but this would be invaluable at this time see page at http sel2in.com pages prog java apache hc QuickStart.htmlQuick Start for http hc.apache.org add under nav DocumentationTushar Many thanks for this contribution I ll move the content from Wiki to the main project site by the time HttpClient 4.0 goes final. OlegQuick start guide ported to the main site. Oleg
