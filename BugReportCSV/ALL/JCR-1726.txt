Hudson build doesn t detect Java 5 class references
Due to the fact that the Maven 2 support in Hudson only works on Java 5 our current CI build at http hudson.zones.apache.org hudson job Jackrabbit-trunk doesn t detect references to classes and methods that are only available in the Java 5 class library.There is now a simple Java 1.4 build http hudson.zones.apache.org hudson job Jackrabbit-trunk-java14 that is automatically executed after all successful Java 1.5 builds of Jackrabbit trunk. This is a workaround but should achieve the goal of automatically alerting us whenever Java 1.5 features creep in the codebase.
