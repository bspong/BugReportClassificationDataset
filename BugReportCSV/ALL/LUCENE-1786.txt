improve performance of contrib TestCompoundWordTokenFilter
contrib analyzers compound has some tests that use a hyphenation grammar file. The tests are currently for german and they actually are nice they show how the combination of the hyphenation rules and dictionary work in tandem. The issue is that the german grammar file is not apache licensed http offo.sourceforge.net hyphenation licenses.html So the test must download the entire offo zip file from sourceforge to execute. I happen to think the test is a great example of how this thing works with a language where it matters but we could consider using a different grammar file for a language that is apache licensed. This way it could be included in the source with the test and would be more practical. attached patch uses the apache2 licensed danish hyphenation dictionary for testing compounds instead. if there is no objection I will commit shortly. Patch looks good Except my Danish is rusty... . This test is now wicked fast junit Testsuite org.apache.lucene.analysis.compound.TestCompoundWordTokenFilter junit Tests run 5 Failures 0 Errors 0 Time elapsed 0.322 sec Committed revision 892355.
