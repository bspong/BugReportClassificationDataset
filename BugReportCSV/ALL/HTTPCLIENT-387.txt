DefaultHttpParamsFactory.getDefaultParams is not thread safe
The method getDefaultParams in org.apache.commons.httpclient.params.DefaultHttpParamsFactory is not thread safe. In this code     public HttpParams getDefaultParams         if httpParams null             httpParams createParams                  return httpParams      it is possible that httpParams will be called by one thread which will set httpParams then a second thread may call it and may find httpParams is non-null. However under both the old Java Language Spec chapter 17 and new Java Memory Models the second thread won t necessarily see the values the first thread has set in the referenced HttpParams object. The easiest way to fix this for all JVMs and memory models is by declaring getDefaultParams to be synchronized.Thanks for filing a bug report. If I remember correctly this method was intentionally left unsynchronized since calling createParams more than once has no real negative side effects. Having said that it does seems somewhat unclean to leave this open. I ll make getDefaultParams synchronized in CVS shortly. MikePatch applied to HEAD. MikeYes calling createParams twice is ok. This is a bug about assigning to a reference variable which is shared between threads without using synchronization. That can have what the Java Language Specification Chapter 17 calls surprising consequences. Thanks for synchronizing it.
