importXML still depends on Xerces
Przemo Pakulski commented on JCR-367 Jackrabbit-core is still dependent on Xerces directly during runtime SessionImpl.importWorkspace Workspacempl.importWorkspace methods contains folliwng lines XMLReader parser XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser It works in maven1 probably because maven1 itself needs xerces to run test goal. I suggest reopening the issue. Creating a new issue since JCR-367 is already closed after the 1.1 release.Fixed in revision 467501. Thanks for reporting this There are still tests dependent on Xercec in org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api package - AbstractImportXmlTest - SerializationTest It will be nice to remove dependency from tests too.Agreed thanks for the update Reopened.Attached a patch that removes the Xerces dependency from the mentioned test cases. Note that I also replaced a number of long throws clauses with a simple throws Exception to avoid adding another exception ParserConfigurationException to the list. This shouldn t be a problem since the only recipient of the exceptions is the unit test framework that doesn t really care about the type of the exception. I m a bit worried about making direct changes to the TCK codebase so could someone who s more involved with the TCK quickly review the patch before I commit it I don t see any problems as the change should have no functional effects I just want to make sure I don t accidentally mess with something important.Applied the patch revision 468956. That should be the last Xerces dependency at least a grep for xerces didn t bring out any new issues. Resolving as Fixed.
