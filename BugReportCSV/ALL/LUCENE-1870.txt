dists include analyzer contrib in src dist but not binary dist
dists include analyzer contrib in src dist but not binary dist this one snuck by my grr - embarrsing - spent all that time with the src dist and not enough with the binary dist - db and misc are missing too - I ve fixed db and analyzers working on misc now is this because analyzers and db have sub-module folders okay - misc is there - there is also just a miscellaneous folder with just a readme.txt in it - about to find the fix for that... is this because analyzers and db have sub-module folders Yup - the build process only went 1 deep for jars the misc problem stems from having the folder as miscellanous and then a shorted misc form that gets sent out - this is confusing an error prone - other build files have to refer to both long and short version. I m just going to rename the folder to misc and make everything the short version unless anyone objects. okay - I think I ve addressed it all - will leave this open until im 1000 sure Okay I think its good - that misc issue was actually in the last release so I think I made the right move with the rename
