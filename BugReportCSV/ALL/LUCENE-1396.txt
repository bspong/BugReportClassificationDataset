Improve PhraseQuery.toString 
PhraseQuery.toString is overly simplistic in that it doesn t correctly show phrases with gaps or overlapping terms. This may be misleading when presenting phrase queries built using complex analyzers and filters. This patch improves toString and adds a unit test. Gaps are represented as and overlapping terms are separated by a vertial bar sign. Example Query string hi this is a test Parsed using StopFilter hi test Added term hello at position 1 hi hello test Added term hello at position 0 hi hello test I think this is a good improvement and the patch is minor. I plan to commit to 2.4 2.9. Thanks Andrzej Committed revision 697469 trunk and 697470 2.4 . Thanks Andrzej
