Refactor TestIndexWriter
TestIndexWriter is getting a bit unwieldy 5 315 lines of code 116 test methods runtimes frequently between 1 and 2 minutes. It starts to be pretty scary to merge changes because its so massive. A lot of the tests arguably belong somewhere else e.g. the addIndex tests belong in TestAddIndexes But here is a start Pulls out the OnDiskFull tests into TestIndexWriterOnDiskFull Pulls out the multithreaded tests into TestIndexWriterWithThreads Yay This is badly needed Ok i ll commit merge then take a look if there s any other obvious steps we can make here. but this one is simple and speeds up the tests a lot here s a second patch moves the exceptions tests into TestIndexWriterExceptions and the addIndexes tests into TestAddIndexes here s a final patch to move termvectors-writing tests to TestTermVectorsWriter. sure some were really bugs in IW but some were in TVWriter too and i think it makes logical sense i d like to resolve the issue with this one TestIW is about half its former self. Committed revision 1031496 1031500. Bulk close for 3.1
