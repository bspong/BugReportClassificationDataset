Provide Programmatic Access to CheckIndex
Would be nice to have programmatic access to the CheckIndex tool so that it can be used in applications like Solr. See SOLR-566 Here s some incomplete doodling on this issue. Haven t had time to finish it off but thought I d get it out of my source tree for now and come back to it later. Hi Grant the patch looks good I tweaked it a bit to pass all tests and also pulled out a separate fix method as suggested here http mail-archives.apache.org mod mbox lucene-java-dev 200809.mbox 3C4d0b24970809061944n5c617b36xc2951d74d989dc42 40mail.gmail.com 3E If this looks good can you commit for 2.4 will do.

However I reproduced it from an old version here plus your additions. Has CheckIndexStatus. Will commit shortly Mike I think you forgot to add the CheckIndexStatus class to your patch. However I reproduced it from an old version here plus your additions. Woops sorry. We really need the svn patch command so that it would have locally added that file on me applying the patch. Sigh. But you worked around this just fine Grant this is now fixed right
