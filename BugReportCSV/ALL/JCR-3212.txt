add TCK test for Info map of NODE MOVED event on node reordering
add the TCK test for this problem and mark this as known test failure for nowTurns out that we have test cases for these operations in the TCK see org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.observation.NodeReorderTest. However these tests have been written in a way that also causes the incorrect reporting of reorder data in the info map. I wouldn t want to remove this completely because then other aspects ADDED REMOVED events wouldn t be tested anymore once we mark the tests as failing in Jackrabbit . Instead we could refactor the tests to check REMOVED and ADDED independently from MOVED. ÊFTR the relevant commit was in revision 1233069. Jira doesn t see it because the issue referenced in the commit was JCR-3207. I fixed the commit message afterwards with svn propset revprop svn log .
