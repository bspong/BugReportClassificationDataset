SearchWithSortTask ignores sorting by Doc
During my work in LUCENE-3912 I found the following code if field.equals doc sortField0 SortField.FIELD DOC if field.equals score sortField0 SortField.FIELD SCORE ... This means the setting of SortField.FIELD DOC is ignored. While I don t know much about this code this seems like a valid setting and obviously just a bug. Test demonstrating error. Simple patch fixing the problem. Do I need a CHANGES entry for trivial things like this Simple patch fixing the problem. Do I need a CHANGES entry for trivial things like this looks good I don t think we need a changes entry for this. go ahead and commit Committed revision 1137882.
