Core WEAKREFERENCE properties object have type REFERENCE when being read from the persistent layer
it seems to me that WEAKREFERENCE properties are properly created and stored as such but are read as REFERENCE properties when built again from the persistent layer. how to reproduce - create a new WEAKREFERENCE property and save the changes - force reading from the persistent layer in my case I used Day s CRX and restartet the server - the former WEAKREFERENCE will now be displayed as REFERENCE. i think this problem is caused by BundleBinding readPropertyEntry that creates InternalValues without indicating if the reference is weak or not. i would be glad if someone can quickly review that and confirm that this solves the problem. in my CRX test see steps how i could reproduce the problem above this seemed to work. 1 for the patch thanks stefan
