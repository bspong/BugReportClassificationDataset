Node.orderBefore and JackrabbitNode.rename should check for ability to modify children-collection on parent node
currently the implementation of Node.orderBefore and JackrabbitNode.rename perform the same validation that is executed for a move operation which includes removal of the original node. however the methods mentioned above only include a manipulation on the child-node-collection of the parent subset of the current check . therefore the permission check should be adjusted accordingly.Merged to the 2.2 branch in revision 1202725.
