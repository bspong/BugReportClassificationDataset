FastVectorHighlighter SimpleBoundaryScanner does not work well when highlighting at the beginning of the text
The SimpleBoundaryScanner still breaks text not based on characters provided when highlighting text that end up scanning to the beginning of the text to highlight. In this case just use the start of the text as the offset. Attached fix. This causes the SimpleFragmentsBuilderTest testMVSeparator to fail because it has empty string fields which are separated by a custom separator. I think if you do that the boundy config should include the separator character not sure what the implications are to ignore empty strings . I can fix it to do so if the patch make sense. Patch makes sense. This causes the SimpleFragmentsBuilderTest testMVSeparator to fail because it has empty string fields which are separated by a custom separator. Yes. I think that just fixing the expected string in testMVSeparator is fine. patch that just fixing the expected string in testMVSeparator. trunk Committed revision 1232769. 3x Committed revision 1232783.
