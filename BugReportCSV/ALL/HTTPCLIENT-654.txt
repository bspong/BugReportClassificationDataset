Cookie class cannot handle IPv6 literals
When performing requests using IPv6 literals Cookie.setDomain will attempt to trim the port number by cutting off the domain string at the first colon. This leads to MalformedCookieExceptions being thrown by CookieSpecBase later on.Hello Alexander please see whether the attached patch fixes the problem. Maybe you could contribute a unit test cheers   Roland Literal IPv6 addresses are not and will not be officially supported by HttpClient 3.x. Even if we can fix this specific problem that does not mean that IPv6 literals will work as expected. For example domain matching in cookies may or may not do what you expect. We don t know and there are no test cases. cheers   Roland To be fixed in 4.0 codeline where we could make use of regexp to test whether a cookie domain attribute is a IPv4 or IPv6 address OlegI was too tired yesterday. This one has a chance of working...This method has been removed in HttpClient 4.0 branch OlegI am also Facing the Problem using Httpclient for uploading the file in IPV6 scenario i.e. File Uploads fails. Is there any alternative solution for it.Whether the problem is due to I am passing Literal IPV6 address as a server URL.
