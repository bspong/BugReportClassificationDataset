FastVectorHighlighter Make FragmentsBuilder use Encoder
Make FragmentsBuilder use Encoder as Highlighter does. This patch breaks back-compat because I added two methods that take Encoder to FragmentsBuilder interface. But using the methods bring in per-field override feature in Solr. JUnit test added. As I change the FragmentsBuilder interface in this ticket I want to use this opportunity to take tag arrays in the added methods. This change enables tags to be set per-field override in Solr. I ll commit tomorrow. trunk Committed revision 982824. branch 3x Committed revision 982828. Bulk close for 3.1
