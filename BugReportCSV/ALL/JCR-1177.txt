Move jackrabbit trunk contrib to jackrabbit sandbox
As discussed on the mailing list see http www.nabble.com Moving-contrib-outside-trunk-and-rename-to-sandbox-tf4635301.html we should do the following     svn move https svn.apache.org repos asf jackrabbit trunk contrib https svn.apache.org repos asf jackrabbit sandbox I will do this in a few days unless anyone objects.Would it make sense to delay this until we have moved JCR2SPI out of contrib No problem delaying for a while.Move committed in revision 587542.
