NTLM class registers Sun JCE implementation by default
Currently the NTLM class attempts to load and register the Sun JCE implementation unless a System property is set to indicate a different JCE to use. We should remove this entirely and leave the installation and configuration of the JCE to the application rather than trying to do it ourselves as this could cause problems with other implementations of JCE. I ll attach an initial patch for this in a moment with a patch for the documentation in the morning. Writing docs at 1am is never a good idea. Created an attachment id 7819 Patch take 1. I think it s good to be committed to both 2.0 HEAD. OlegGo for it.Created an attachment id 7829 Patch take 2. This time with docs. The latest patch includes the removal of the auto-JCE configuration stuff the docs for that and the javadoc clean up of the NTLM classes. If I don t hear any objections I ll commit it since there hasn t been any substantial change since the other patches there were okay d.Committed to 2.0 and HEAD.
