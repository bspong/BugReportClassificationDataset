Get javadoc for the similarities package in shape
1. Create a package.html in the similarities package. 2. Update the javadoc of the search package package.html mentions Similarity 3. Compile the javadoc to see if there are any warnings. 1. Fixed the javadoc warnings in EasySimilarity. 2. Okapi paper reference added to BM25Similarity. 3. Added package-level javadoc for the similarities package. 4. Moved the Changing Similarities part from search to similarities. The similarities package shows up in the core even though it is classified as contrib for javadocs-all. However since the class Similarity is now in similarities shouldn t it be core as well Fixed a typo. Thanks David looks good. The similarities package shows up in the core even though it is classified as contrib for javadocs-all. However since the class Similarity is now in similarities shouldn t it be core as well This is because of an out of date regexp in the javadocs construction. I ll nuke this before committing group title contrib Queries packages org.apache.lucene.search.similar org.apache.lucene.search.regex org.apache.regexp thanks no more javadocs warnings This is because of an out of date regexp in the javadocs construction. I ve found that I just didn t know what to make of it. Since as far as I know a similarities package hadn t existed before I added the new sims I assumed it was there on purpose.
