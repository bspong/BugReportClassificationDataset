add IndexReader.getUniqueTermCount
Simple API to return number of unique terms across all fields . Spinoff from here http www.lucidimagination.com search document 536b22e017be3e27 term limit Attached patch. I plan to commit in a day or two... Hi Mike why not just use getSequentialSubReaders in the default implementation and recursively sum up all term counts getSequentialSubReaders is part of the IndexReader API so also available in the abstract class. SegmentReader can override the method and return its real count. If getSequentialSubReaders returns null throw the UOE. Sorry that cannot work because the segments can share the same terms so the sum is always the real unique term count. Thanks Derek
