document field lengths count analyzer synonym overlays
Using a synonym expansion analyzer to add tokens with zero offset from the substituted token should not extend the length of the field in the document for scoring purposes I m not sure... I can think of examples either way. If a field has a lot of synonyms it will match more terms. Shouldn t it s length be considered longer for the purposes of determining how specific it is to a query What you say would make sense if you thought that queries would contain several synonyms. All my experience says that they don t a person tends to use one synonym and it s the task of the search engine to make sure this matches synonymous terms in the documents of course I come from a world where default boolean query is conjunctive so you d never get any hits if you added a pile of synonyms into the query . I think LUCENE-1420 fixed this.
