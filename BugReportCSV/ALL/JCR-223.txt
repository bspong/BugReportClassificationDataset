fix jackrabbit groupId
Actually the groupid used in maven project.xml is simply jackrabbit . However the new naming policy adopted by maven requires the groupid to mirror the main package name so it should be changed to org.apache.jackrabbit . Probably this could be a good moment to fix it after the recent merge and modification of artifact ids. A note about the new policy for groupid can be found in http maven.apache.org reference repository-upload.htmlYou are right. GroupId changed in revision 292295. Thanks for the suggestion I m not sure but doesn t that mean we have to adapt all other project.xml files as well that depend on jackrabbit Namely in modules commons and contrib I m not sure but doesn t that mean we have to adapt all other project.xml files as well that depend on jackrabbit yes there are also a couple of other things that should be fixed in all the project.xml - the scm url is wrong should be scm svn ... and not scm subversion ... - dependencies should use the groupId artifactId sintax and not simply id ... this has been deprecated a long time ago.

SCM URLs and dependencies changed as proposed.
