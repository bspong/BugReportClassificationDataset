CharReader should delegate reset mark markSupported
The final class CharReader should delegate reset mark markSupported to its wrapped reader. Otherwise clients will get reset not supported exception. CharFilter can delegate too. I d like to call reset to rewind reader in SOLR-1256. I think this patch looks good. I will commit shortly. Committed revision 791415. Thanks Koji
