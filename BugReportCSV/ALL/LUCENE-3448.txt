Add FixedBitSet.and other DISI andNot other DISI 
For the parent issue and and andNot on DISIs and other FixedBitSets are missing. This issue will add those methods. The DISI methods also the already existing or DISI method will check for OpenBitSetIterator and do an inplace operation using the bits as optimization. Patch. I opened LUCENE-3449 because of a stupidness with nextSetBit . Updated patch some improvements. Also limit DISI to numBits Patch looks good Uwe Committed trunk revision 1174377 Committed missing tests in trunk revision 1174407 Backported to 3.x branch revision 1174418 This patch fixes the optimized OpenBitSetIterator and or andNot methods to correctly exhaust the iterator after applying the underlying bits. Committed fix in trunk revision 1204416 Committed fix in 3.x revision 1204419 Bulk close after release of 3.5
