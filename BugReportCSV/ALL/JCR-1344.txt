Unsynchronized NameFactoryImpl initialization
org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.commons.name.NameFactoryImpl uses an unsafe pattern when initializing     private static NameFactory FACTORY     private NameFactoryImpl     public static NameFactory getInstance         if FACTORY null             FACTORY new NameFactoryImpl                  return FACTORY      This is bad in a multi-threaded environment see http www.ibm.com developerworks library j-dcl.html for details .Committed in revision 614911It s not really harmful as there s no state in NameFactoryImpl but I agree that the if statement there is not needed. Better to just initialize the FACTORY constant where it s declared.
