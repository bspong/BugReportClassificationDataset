WebDAV Library VersionControlledResource constant lists wrong method
VersionControlledResource .methods checkedIn constant lists UNCHECKOUT which is obviously wrong. RFC3253 lists the UNCHECKOUT method as mandatory method for checked-out vc-resource for the checkout-in-place feature.fixed rev. 393414 Note The current solution of listing dav-methods supported by a particular type of resource is not very satifying. Mainly due to the fact that RFC 3253 defines various feature sets that may or may not be supported. The single-string constant does not reflect this. I will post a separate enhancement request that should address this. Merged for 1.0.1 in revision 409540.
