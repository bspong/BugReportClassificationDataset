AttributeSource holds strong reference to class instances and prevents unloading e.g. in Solr if webapplication reload and custom attributes in separate classloaders are used e.g. in the Solr plugins classloader 
When working on the dynmaic proxy classes using cglib javaassist i recognized a problem in the caching code inside AttributeSource AttributeSource has a static cache map that holds implementation classes for attributes to be faster on creating new attributes reflection cost AttributeSource has a static cache map that holds a list of all interfaces implemented by a specific AttributeImpl Also VirtualMethod in 3.1 hold a map of implementation distances keyed by subclasses of the deprecated API Both have the problem that this strong reference is inside Lucene s classloader and so persists as long as lucene lives. The classes referenced can never be unloaded therefore which would be fine if all live in the same classloader. As soon as the Attribute or implementation class or the subclass of the deprecated API are loaded by a different classloder e.g. Lucene lives in bootclasspath of tomcat but lucene-consumer with custom attributes lives in a webapp they can never be unloaded because a reference exists. Libs like CGLIB or JavaAssist or JDK s reflect.Proxy have a similar cache for generated class files. They also manage this by a WeakHashMap. The cache will always work perfect and no class will be evicted without reason as classes are only unloaded when the classloader goes and this will only happen on request e.g. by Tomcat . Attached patch. I will commit this in a day and also merge to 2.9 and 3.0 without VirtualMethod as this is a resource leak. This problem is similar to LUCENE-2182. Improved patch now all class references are weak. The assumption on the WeakReference inside addAttributeImpl is always null is true because the code has a strong reference on the implementing class. Patch for 2.9 branch without Java 5 generics I ll commit this soon Committed trunk revision 909360 Committed 2.9 revision 909361 Committed 3.0 revision 909365
