Consolidate Solr s and Lucene s OpenBitSet classes
See SOLR-875 for details. Simple patch that adds two methods to OpenBitSetIterator nextDoc and next int . These work just as next and skipTo int with the difference that they return the new docId instead of true false. Also improves the unit tests to test the new methods and moves testBitUtils from Solr into Lucene. All tests pass. I m planning to commit this in a day or so. Michael what do nextDoc and next int return when there are no more docs ie the iterator is done They return -1. next int has a comment which states that I will make it clearer in the javadocs of nextDoc . Committed revision 720609.
