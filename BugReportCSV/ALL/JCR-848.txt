javacc-maven-plugin version in jackrabbit-core pom file
Hi I noticed that the pom.xml file of the jackrabbit-core project needs to specify version 2.1 for the javacc-maven-plugin because if it takes the 2.2-SNAPSHOT it won t compile. I put the 2.1 version and it worked fine. plugin          groupId org.codehaus.mojo groupId          artifactId javacc-maven-plugin artifactId          version 2.1 version          executions Im working with revision 529712 April 17 2007 15 05 EST Which Maven version are you using I guess the default javacc-maven-plugin version comes from Maven. The current jackrabbit-core POM works fine for me with Maven 2.0.4 and 2.0.6.Wow this was more than a month ago now when I did svn update nothing compiles at all. I m using Maven 2.0.6 that time I was using 2.0.4.

I ve tried multiple combinations of Maven 2.0.x JDK 1.4 5 6 and Linux Windows. Please reopen with exact Maven and JDK versions if you still see this after cleaning your local Maven repository .Lucene had the same problem see http issues.apache.org jira browse LUCENE-490 . JavaCC 4.0 broke two of the grammar files QueryParser.jjt and XPath.jjt. The attached patch fixes it.Thank you for the provided patch. Applied the patch in revision 555897 I also adapted src main javacc xpath javacc.xsl which generates XPath.jjt.Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 558161.
