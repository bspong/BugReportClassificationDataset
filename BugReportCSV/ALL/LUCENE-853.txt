Caching does not work when using RMI
Filters and caching uses transient maps so that caching does not work if you are using RMI and a remote searcher I want to add a new RemoteCachededFilter that will make sure that the caching is done on the remote searcher side This is a patch that will allow uses to cache Filters even when using RMI This is new and better version of my Lucene patch A new version that will hopefully patch more correctly Nice. Unit tests pass and caching seems to work. I ll make some small javadoc and cosmetic fixes upload the prettified patch and commit on Friday. This will give 2 more days to others to review your changes and raise any issues they may see. Thanks Matt Here is a cleaned up version. Changed CachingWrapperFilter - private - protected vars so CachingWrapperFilterHelper can extend it Expanded unit tests to be more convincing Javadocs all fixed up cosmetics code comments n.b. The todo in CachingWrapperFilter can go now todo What about serialization in RemoteSearchable Caching won t work. Should transient be removed protected transient Map cache We keep the transient and if you want remote caching use RemoteCachingWrapperFilter. I ll commit on Friday. Committed thanks Matt.
