Provide access to SSLSession in ManagedClientConnection
Provide access to the wrappedConnection in org.apache.http.impl.conn.AbstractClientConnAdapter via some interface in order to access the socket from within an HttpProcessor. Currently the org.apache.http.conn.OperatedClientConnection has a getSocket method but the connection implementation returned by   context.getAttribute ExecutionContext.HTTP CONNECTION org.apache.http.impl.conn.tsccm.BasicPooledConnAdapter does not provide access to the wrappedConnection.Would giving access to the SSLSession be sufficient Do we really need to expose the underlying socket OlegThe wrapped connection and socket should not be easily accessible directly. Direct access interferes with connection management. Applications in dire need of that feature should use an extended connection manager. see the discussion on httpcomponents-dev I ve added ManagedClientConnection.getSSLSession . Could you give it a try cheers   Roland
