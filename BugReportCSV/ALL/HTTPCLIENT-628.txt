AutoCloseInputStream.available throws IOException when auto-closed
ACIS auto-close itself as soon as EOF is detected. That leads to IOExceptions being throw in response to calls that are valid for a stream that has reached EOF. ACIS should instead close the underlying stream and switch itself into an EOF mode that does not throw exceptions until it is closed explicitly. reported by Tom Lipkis on the developer mailing list http mail-archives.apache.org mod mbox jakarta-httpcomponents-dev 200702.mbox 3c200702101905.l1AJ5MeK027997 fw3.pss.com 3eACIS already behaved as expected for the read methods. Only the available method was missing. cheers   Roland Looks good OlegPatch committed with updated release notes.
