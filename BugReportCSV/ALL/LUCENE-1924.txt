BalancedSegmentMergePolicy contributed from the Zoie project for realtime indexing
Written by Yasuhiro Matsuda for Zoie realtime indexing system used to handle high update rates to avoid large segment merges. Detailed write-up is at http code.google.com p zoie wiki ZoieMergePolicy this is a stand-alone class This looks great John thanks. Where would you put it contrib misc maybe I had put them in the core package under org.apache.lucene.index. Because it requires access package protected classes e.g. SegmentInfo it needs to be in that package. In terms of which module totally up to you as you would know what the best place to put it. A question on the side MergePolicy is something the API suggests that is customizable yet SegmentInfo part of the signature is package protected. Is this something should be opened up to allow for full customization of MergePolicy amonst other things Thanks -John We ve opened up SegmentInfo s in 2.9. Awesome didn t realize Thanks -John Trivial formatting changes basic javadoc and moved to contrib misc. Thanks Yasuhiro John
