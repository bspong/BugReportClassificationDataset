Default lock timeouts should have static setter getters
We recently stopped using Java system properties to derive defaults for things like the write commit lock timeout and switched to getter setter s across all classes. See here http www.gossamer-threads.com lists lucene java-dev 27447 But in the case at least of the write lock timeout because it s marked public final static a consumer of this API can no longer change this value before instantiating the IndexWriter. This is because the getter setter for this is not static which generally makes sense so you can change the timeout for each instance of IndexWriter. But because IndexWriter on construction uses the timeout value some uses cases need to change the value before getting an instance of IndexWriter. This was actually a regression in that Lucene users lost functionality they previously had on upgrading. I would propose that that we add getter setter for the default value of this timeout which would be static. I ll attach a patch file. See this thread for context that led to this issue http www.gossamer-threads.com lists lucene java-dev 37421 Small changes to IndexWriter.java to add default static getter setters for COMMIT LOCK TIMEOUT and WRITE LOCK TIMEOUT. Patch to add calls to the new static default setter getters into the existing TestIndexWriter unit test. Another recent thread that noted the regression in Lucene 2.0 http www.gossamer-threads.com lists lucene java-user 36561 patches applied cleanly with no obvious downsides that I could think of. commited with some minor javadoc tweaks added missing see declaration to some javadoc lines in the patch and aded some new see declarations to the existing static variables pointing at the new setters Wow thanks for the fast resolution here
