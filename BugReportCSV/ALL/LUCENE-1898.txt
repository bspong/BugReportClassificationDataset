Decide if we should remove lines numbers from latest Changes
As Lucene dev has grown a new issue has arisen - many times new changes invalidate old changes. A proper changes file should just list the changes from the last version not document the dev life of the issues. Keeping changes in proper order now requires a lot of renumbering sometimes. The numbers have no real meaning and could be added to more rich versions such as the html version automatically if desired. I think an makes a good replacement myself. The issues already have ids that are stable rather than the current decorational numbers which are subject to change over a dev cycle. I think we should replace the numbers with an asterix for the 2.9 section and going forward ie 4. becomes . If we don t get consensus very quickly this issue won t block. changes2html.pl doesn t fully grok the new format - items are numbered but the asterisks are left in in some cases. I ll work up a patch. contrib benchmark CHANGES has a different format dates instead of numbers and maybe do this for contrib CHANGES too 1 makes sense. Patch to changes2html.pl that can handle as bulleted item indicator. Also converts numbered items in contrib CHANGES.txt for 2.9 release to bullets. This patch incorporates Mark s numbered- bulleted modifications to CHANGES.txt as well as correcting one numbered item that Mark missed and converting tabs to spaces in the first code section so that the method parameters line up in the output HTML. 1. makes sense. Even in the HTML I don t think it s necessary for the changes to be numbered. Bullets will also work for me. 1 1 That would be really nice. We always have this duplicate numbers cascading renumbering and so on. I think numbering of items is part of the presentation layer like in XHTML where you have numbered lists Thanks a million Steve r812493
