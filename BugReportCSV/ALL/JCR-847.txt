Provide a Method getCredentialsProvider to the SimpleWebdavServlet
It will be useful to provide a easy way to change the default CredentialsProvider BasicCredentialsProvider when the SessionProvider will be created. It makes sense to let the SessionProvider return a other CredentialsProvider so that no BasicAuthentication wil be prompt. thanks clausMaybe it will be released in the 1.3 version provides the method.Looks good thanks I ll get it included still in 1.3.Patch applied with some extra javadocs in revision 530119 and merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 530121. Thanks for the contribution
