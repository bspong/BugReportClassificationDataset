Index creates many folders when re-indexing
When the repository is re-indexed the search index creates a lot of directories which are finally cleaned up. If the repository contains a lot of content the number of directories that are created can be quite high thousands of directories . The re-indexing process should clean up unused index folders right away and not wait until the changes are committed.Index segments that are not used anymore i.e. have been merged into a larger one are now deleted right away.
