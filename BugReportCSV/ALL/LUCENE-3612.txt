remove X.fnx
Currently we store a global not per-segment field number- name mapping in X.fnx However it doesn t actually save us any performance e.g on IndexWriter s init because since LUCENE-2984 we are to loading the fieldinfos anyway to compute files for IFD etc as thats where hasProx hasVectors is. Additionally in the past global files like shared doc stores have caused us problems recently we just fixed a bug related to this file in LUCENE-3601 . Finally this is trouble for backwards compatibility as its difficult to handle a global file with the codecs mechanism. Patch all tests pass. before committing I think we should cleanup some apis javadocs remove the various versioning stuff now unused and not read write it in segments files. 1 1 updated patch i just removed the file version information and no longer write it in segments file and removed the Directory parameter from the map getter etc. I plan to commit soon.
