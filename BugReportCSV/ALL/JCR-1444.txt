The getOutputStream of the MemoryFileSystem class can replace a folder with a newly created file
It seems that if the filePath parameter passed to the getOutputStream method of the MemoryFileSystem class points to an existing folder and not to a file - the folder will be replaced with a newly created file. The function should probably check whether the passed path points to a file and throw an exception if it points to a folder.fixed in r635583Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 650532.
