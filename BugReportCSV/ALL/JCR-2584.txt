Switch from log4j to Logback
Logback http logback.qos.ch is a native SLF4J implementation and is in many ways superior to log4j see http logback.qos.ch reasonsToSwitch.html . Most notably it includes package version information in logged stack traces http logback.qos.ch reasonsToSwitch.html packagingData which can be really useful in many cases. 1 I specially like the version information http logback.qos.ch reasonsToSwitch.html packagingData That should be enabled by default.I switched the dependency in Jackrabbit trunk. This may be a bit too late for 2.1 so I won t merge the changes to the branch. Instead targeting Jackrabbit 2.2.
