Remove per-document multiply in FilteredQuery
Spinoff of LUCENE-1536. In LUCENE-1536 Uwe suggested using FilteredQuery under-the-hood to implement filtered search. But this query is inefficient it does a per-document multiplication wrapped.score boost . Instead it should just pass the boost down in its weight like BooleanQuery does to avoid this per-document multiply. 1 commit this so i can move forward with 1536 Thanks for help Bulk close after release of 3.5
