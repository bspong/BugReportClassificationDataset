Data store garbage collection ScanEventListener not working
The ScanEventListener is currently only called when using the scan all nodes recursively strategy. It is not called when all persistence managers implement IterablePersistenceManager GarbageCollector.scanPersistenceManagers . The ScanEventListener should be called in every case otherwise it is not possible to see the progress of the garbage collection. However there is a problem IterablePersistenceManager.getAllNodeIds doesn t return Node objects and it would make little sense to create real node objects the performance advantage of scanPersistenceManagers would be lost . Therefore I propose a workaround the ScanEventListener is called using a PseudoNode . This is a class that implements Node but only has meaningful getUUID and toString methods. This allows to create a meaningful progress bar as the UUIDs are returned in order .Do we really need a meaningful progress bar for the garbage collection process What s the use case This sounds like added complexity with little real benefit.Why do you need to pass the full node to the ScanEventListener Wouldn t passing a NodeId be enough or even just calling a no-argument method to indicate that a node was scanned AFAIUI you only need the ratio of nodes scanned vs. total number of nodes to display a good progress bar.Fixed in revision 636774. This patch introduces two new methods GarbageCollector.setPersistenceManagerScan and getPersistenceManagerScan. Also the ScanEventListener is called even when using the PersistenceManager scan however with a null Node. My first idea was to add a PseudoNode class but passing null is probably OK. In that case the client could count how many times the method was called. I remember there is a way to get the number of nodes in a repository jcr.repository.stats.nodes.count . I agree the NodeId would be OK as well however I think we should not change the API in a minor release. I hope this patch can be included in the next minor Jackrabbit release. OK merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 638066.
