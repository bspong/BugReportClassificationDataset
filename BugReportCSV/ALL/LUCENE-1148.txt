Create a new sub-class of SpanQuery to enable use of a RangeQuery within a SpanQuery
Our users express queries using a syntax which enables them to embed various query types within SpanQuery instances. One feature they ve been asking for is the ability to embed a numeric range query so they could for example find documents matching 2.0 2.75 MHz . The attached patch adds the capability and I hope others will find it useful. This is the initial patch referenced in the Jira issue. This one is fixed by LUCENE-2754 you can just wrap a RangeQuery or any other MultiTermQuery as a SpanQuery Bulk close for 3.1
