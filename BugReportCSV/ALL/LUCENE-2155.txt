random localization test failures
Some tests fail randomly hard to reproduce . It appears to me that this is caused by uninitialized date fields. For example Uwe reported a failure today in this test of TestQueryParser for testing legacy DateField support public void testLegacyDateRange throws Exception String startDate getLocalizedDate 2002 1 1 false String endDate getLocalizedDate 2002 1 4 false if you look at the helper getLocalizedDate you can see if the 4th argument is false it does not initialize all date field functions. private String getLocalizedDate int year int month int day boolean extendLastDate Calendar calendar new GregorianCalendar calendar.set year month day if extendLastDate calendar.set Calendar.HOUR OF DAY 23 calendar.set Calendar.MINUTE 59 calendar.set Calendar.SECOND 59 ... I think the solution to this is that in all tests whereever we create new GregorianCalendar it should be followed by a call to Calendar.clear . This will ensure that we always initialize unused calendar fields to zero rather than being dependent on the local time. attached is a patch that not only clears all Calendar attributes to erase anything dependent on local time but also ensures the same hour minute second millisecond is used for actual and expected. This is because the date in the test 2002 1 4 becomes two different Thai dates depending upon the hour of day timezone etc. The expected end date was always 4 2 2545 because these were set. But the actual end date would sometimes be 3 2 2545 depending upon when and where you ran the tests. Committed revision 890407. This may not be the complete solution but its at least an improvement. I still do not trust these tests are doing exactly what we think...
