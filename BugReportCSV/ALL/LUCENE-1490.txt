CJKTokenizer convert HALFWIDTH AND FULLWIDTH FORMS wrong
CJKTokenizer have these lines.. if ub Character.UnicodeBlock.HALFWIDTH AND FULLWIDTH FORMS convert HALFWIDTH AND FULLWIDTH FORMS to BASIC LATIN int i int c i i - 65248 c char i This is wrong. Some character in the block e.g. U ff68 have no BASIC LATIN counterparts. Only 65281-65374 can be converted this way. The fix is if ub Character.UnicodeBlock.HALFWIDTH AND FULLWIDTH FORMS i 65474 i 65281 convert HALFWIDTH AND FULLWIDTH FORMS to BASIC LATIN int i int c i i - 65248 c char i Adding trunk release 2.9 to fix version too Thanks Daniel This was discovered by Chan http www.cnblogs.com jjstar archive 2006 12 20 598016.html
