not all applicable URIs are invalidated on PUT POST DELETEs that pass through client cache
 Some HTTP methods MUST cause a cache to invalidate an entity. This is either the entity referred to by the Request-URI or by the Location or Content-Location headers if present . These methods are PUT DELETE POST. http www.w3.org Protocols rfc2616 rfc2616-sec13.html sec13.10 The current caching implementation only invalidates the Request URI and not those present in the Location or Content-Location headers on the request. I have a patch that fixes this which I will upload momentarily. The attached patch addresses this issue by also invalidating absolute and relative URIs in Content-Location headers and absolute URIs in Location headers as long as they address the same host as the original request. Includes updates to associated unit tests. This patch is contributed to the ASF with the permission of my employer. Patch checked in. Many thanks Jon Oleg
