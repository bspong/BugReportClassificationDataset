Add Thread-Safety note to IndexWriter JavaDoc
IndexWriter Javadocs should contain a note about thread-safety. This is already mentioned on the wiki FAQ page but such an essential information should be part of the module documentation too. Tweaked the wording... Simon if this looks OK to you I ll commit shortly looks good to me. OK thanks Simon By the way Do we have a TS note for IndexReader We don t afaik. I ll add to IndexReader IndexSearcher as well. IndexReader IndexSearcher as well. Added small but important fact about the synchronization Object. Everything else looks good to me OK another rev I backed away from giving particulars on how should synchronize and just said generically use your own non-Lucene objects instead . looks good. private final Object is rather a general best practice than something lucene or module specific. simon
