RMI-DateValue does not support full ISO8601 format
as mentioned in the javadoc Ê To convert code Calendar code instances to and from strings this class Ê uses a code SimpleDateFormat code instance with the pattern Ê code yyyy-MM-dd T HH mm ss Z code . The issue with this pattern is that Ê the era specification as defined in the JCR specification - prefix as Ê well as full time zone naming are not supported. added copy if ISO8601 class. Committed revision 467992.The reason for this is that to easily and properly support full Calendar compliancy the commons library - just for the ISO8601 support class - would probably be required. At the time this has been implemented the respective class has not been available. We should probably now adapt.Reopening to set properties before the 1.1.1 release.
