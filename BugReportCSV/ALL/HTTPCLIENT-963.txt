client cache does not respect Cache-Control no-store on requests
 The purpose of the no-store directive is to prevent the inadvertent release or retention of sensitive information for example on backup tapes . The no-store directive applies to the entire message and MAY be sent either in a response or in a request. If sent in a request a cache MUST NOT store any part of either this request or any response to it. http www.w3.org Protocols rfc2616 rfc2616-sec14.html sec14.9.2 The current implementation will incorrectly cache responses to requests containing Cache-Control no-store .The attached patch resolves this issue and is contributed to the ASF with the permission of my employer. Jon The patch does not apply cleanly to the SVN trunk. Would it be a big deal for you to rebuild it off the latest snapshot OlegHi Oleg No problem I ll regenerate it today. Jon I ve attached a rebuilt patch against trunk. This patch is contributed to the ASF with the permission of my employer. Hhhm. The second does not apply cleanly as well. Are you sure the diff was made against the latest snapshot I am pretty sure isSharedCache has already been added to the CachingHttpClient.java by another patch of yours which I already checked in.
