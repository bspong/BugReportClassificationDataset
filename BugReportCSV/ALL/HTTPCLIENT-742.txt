common interface for HttpRoute and RouteTracker
Classes HttpRoute and RouteTracker have many identical getters. There should be a common interface for example RouteInfo to define these getters and a toRoute method that returns an unmodifiable representation. Some portions of the API may then accept the interface instead of the specific class HttpRoute. This implies moving the TunnelType and LayerType enums to the new interface. We should not delay this change to a later release. Done.
