FrenchAnalyzer s tokenStream method does not honour the contract of Analyzer
In Analyzer Creates a TokenStream which tokenizes all the text in the provided Reader. Default implementation forwards to tokenStream Reader for compatibility with older version. Override to allow Analyzer to choose strategy based on document and or field. Must be able to handle null field name for backward compatibility. public abstract TokenStream tokenStream String fieldName Reader reader and in FrenchAnalyzer public final TokenStream tokenStream String fieldName Reader reader if fieldName null throw new IllegalArgumentException fieldName must not be null if reader null throw new IllegalArgumentException reader must not be null Depends on how you read things - it must be able to handle null for backward compatibility - but contrib analyzers have no explicit back compat requirement - so not supporting such a thing while inconvenient is not necessarily wrong. Committed revision 828298. this inconsistency annoyed me too. thanks Andrew
