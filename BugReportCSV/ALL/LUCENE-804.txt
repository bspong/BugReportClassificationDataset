build.xml result of dist-src should support build-contrib 
Currently the packed src distribution would fail to run ant build-contrib . It would be much nicer if that work. In fact would be nicer if you could even re-pack with it. For now I marked this for 2.1 although I am not yet sure if this is a stopper. This can be easily fixed like this Index build.xml Ñ build.xml revision 507610 build.xml working copy -37 7 37 7 patternset id src.dist.patterns includes src build.xml build.xml docs .txt contrib excludes contrib lib src site build excludes contrib db lib contrib ext-libs src site build patternset id binary.build.dist.patterns includes final.name .jar demo.war.name .war demo.name .jar docs contrib .jar A nicer fix would be to also modify contrib db to have ext-libs rather than lib like gdata but for not holding 2.1 this is good enough I think. Running ant -Dversion 2.1.0 dist dist-src like this and unpacking the src.zip reults in the same content as a clean svn co except for the unwanted index.html . 804.build.xml.patch removes loadable jars from the src dist and adds back in jars that are currently not downloadable. This allows src dist to compile contribs or even to re-dist . src-dist size effect of this - reduced from 8.9 MB to 6.8 MB. 1 Modifying fix version to not be 2.1 thereby clarifying that since releases are to be more frequent this should not be regarded as a stopper to release 2.1. 2 I would like to commit this in a day or so unless anyone points a problem with this . Commited this. Fixing of contrib db to have downloadable jars in ext-lib rather than lib should be done if at all under a separate issue.
