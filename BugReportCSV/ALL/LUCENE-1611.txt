Do not launch new merges if IndexWriter has hit OOME
if IndexWriter has hit OOME it defends itself by refusing to commit changes to the index including merges. But this can lead to infinite merge attempts because we fail to prevent starting a merge. Spinoff from http www.nabble.com semi-infinite-loop-during-merging-td23036156.html. Attached patch to prevent starting new merges after OOME and to throw IllegalStateException in optimize expungeDeletes if OOME is hit. I plan to commit in a day or two. Attached 2.4.1 patch. New patch that fixes a few issues Christiaan found. I think this is ready to commit... I ll wait a few hours. Thanks Christiaan
