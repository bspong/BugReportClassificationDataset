BindableRepositoryFactory requires exact resource type
The org.apache.jackrabbit.jndi.BindableRepositoryFactory class requires the exact class name org.apache.jackrabbit.jndi.BindableRepository to be specified for the JNDI resource that the factory is responsible for. However the current deployment model 2 howto document suggest that the more generic interface name javax.jcr.Repository be used instead. Currently this suggested configuration results in a null JNDI resource . This issue should be fixed by either fixing the documentation I can do this or by relaxing the code in BindableRepositoryFactory. I ll attach a patch that does the latter please comment on what you think is the best solution. This issue was detected during the mailing list thread http thread.gmane.org gmane.comp.apache.jackrabbit.devel 2303Attached a simple patch that shuold fix this issue by relaxing the code in BindableRepositoryFactory.Patch applied in revision 190004 based on Stefan s comment http article.gmane.org gmane.comp.apache.jackrabbit.devel 2319 .
