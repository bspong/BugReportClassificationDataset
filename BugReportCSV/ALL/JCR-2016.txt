ChildNodeEntriesImpl.update logs incorrect errors
The ChildNodeEntriesImpl logs errors on a correct update. ChildInfo iterator contains multiple entries with the same name index or uniqueID - ignore ChildNodeInfo. line 186 Suggested patch that puts the same LinkedNode entry in the LinkedEntries list and the NameMap. This was not the case for the first entry.Updated patch that also makes sure that the correct position is calculated when nodes are reordered during an update.This also sometimes causes a NPE on moving a node. I ll investigate. Also refreshing a node sometimes triggers a NPEFixed at revision 767597 Applied patch with some modifications. Fixed at revision 767618
