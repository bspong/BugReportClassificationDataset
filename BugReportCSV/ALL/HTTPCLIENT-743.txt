Duplicate log of HTTP header
The HTTP header line HTTP 1.1 200 OK r n is duplicated in the wire logs. Seems to be because the line is logged at HttpParser line 131 - readLine InputStream String and at HttpMethodBase line 1980 - readStatusLine HttpState HttpConnection It looks like the latter log should be removed ACKRemoved duplicate commit -m HTTPCLIENT-743 - Duplicate log of HTTP header     Committed revision 632799.
