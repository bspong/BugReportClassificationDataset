Better error message for non-trivial nodetype changes
Currently Jackrabbit only throws a RepositoryException with the message Not yet implemented . This says almost nothing to newcomers and is very time consuming to debug even if you know what is means. It would be better to use the information already availble through NodeTypeDefDiff to provide a more descriptive error message.This patch is just a proposal. Please review. I didn t use StringBuilder for message construction on purpose because I think it s more readable this way and performance shouldn t be an issue here. I uncommented the code for handling non-trivial changes because it doesn t work right now anyway. We could uncomment it when checkForConflictingContent is implemented.Revised patch. Also prints out mixin-flag and supertype changes.Patch applied in revision 526703. Thanks
