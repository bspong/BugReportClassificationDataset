Swap URL Email recognizing StandardTokenizer and UAX29Tokenizer
Currently in addition to implementing the UAX 29 word boundary rules StandardTokenizer recognizes email adresses and URLs but doesn t provide a way to turn this behavior off and or provide overlapping tokens with the components username from email address hostname from URL etc. . UAX29Tokenizer should become StandardTokenizer and current StandardTokenizer should be renamed to something like UAX29TokenizerPlusPlus or something like that . For rationale see the discussion at the reopened LUCENE-2167. Patch to perform the switch on trunk. 1 looks good to me. Updated patch to fix solr CHANGES.txt lucene CHANGES.txt and analysis standard READ BEFORE REGENERATING.txt. I will commit later today if there are no objections. Final patch with URL and E-mail tokenization tests added to Solr s TestUAX29URLEmailTokenizerFactory. I will commit shortly. Committed to trunk revision 1043071 branch 3x revision 1043180 Bulk close for 3.1
