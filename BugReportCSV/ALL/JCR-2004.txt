Update SPI locking to match JCR 2.0
jcr2spi currently uses the JSR 170 way to determine whether a given Session owns the lock by checking of the lock token is null. with JSR 283 a new Lock method has been defined for this while on the other hand the lock token is always null for session-scoped locks. In addition 283-locking allows to specify a timeout hint and hint about the owner info that should be displayed for information purpose. Proposed changes to SPI - extend org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.LockInfo to cover the new functionality added with JSR 283 - add an variant of RepositoryService.lock that allows to specify timeout and owner hint. Proposed changes to JCR2SPI - change jcr2spi to make use of the new functionality and modify the test for session being lock holder.   this mainly affects    LockOperation    LockManager impl    Lock implpatches adjusting jc2spi the spi-implementations in the sandbox and in the trunk and the jcr-server.committed patches at rev. 753244 trunk and rev. 753248 sandbox TODO - timeout impl missing with jackrabbit-core - not tested - remove tmp dependencies to jackrabbit-api and pseudo-283 interfaces jcr2spi spi2jcr jcr-server - merge jcr2spi locking tests to jackrabbit-jcr-tests
