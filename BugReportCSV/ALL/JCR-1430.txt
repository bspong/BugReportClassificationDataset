mvn eclipse eclipse inconsistent

I ll get this committed in a moment...Committed in revision 631908. Thanks this makes many people happy You could further simplify your config for the javacc-maven-plugin by merging the executions. The plugin is capable of determing the package name from the parser file so the parameter packageName is not needed and is actually not even evaluated by the jjtree-javacc goal . The parameter sourceDirectory could in both cases be extended to src main javacc code xml plugin    groupId org.codehaus.mojo groupId    artifactId javacc-maven-plugin artifactId    version 2.4 version    configuration      sourceDirectory src main javacc sourceDirectory    configuration    executions      execution        goals          goal jjtree-javacc goal        goals      execution    executions plugin code In principle this config should allow you to drop in new grammers without the need to touch the plugin config in the POM. Also having the configuration outside of the executions enables you to invoke the plugin directly on the command line i.e. mvn javacc jjtree-javacc .
