Ensure the features.html and index.html adequately give httpclient enough credit
See the email thread started by Eric Johnson. http archives.apache.org eyebrowse BrowseList listId 128 by thread from 316092 Initial post Based on the recent URI discussion and some other points it strikes me that we could take a little more credit for the work that has gone into HttpClient. On the HttpClient home page http jakarta.apache.org commons httpclient index.html four RFCs are listed. Given all the discussion about URIs being thrown around I think it might be reasonable to add RFC 2396 - for URI compliance. Then there is RFC 1867 for multipart form-data POST requests I think I got the right number there . Are there RFCs corresponding to our cookie compliance Any other RFCs we can claim credit for conforming to With the recent Protocol changes I think we ve made it relatively straightforward for clients of HttpClient to plug in their own secure sockets implementations making it easier to use third party non-Sun solutions.Done the first round of this. index.html now discusses generalities where features.html talks about real details and standards compliance. A comparison table with other http clients would still be nice to have.nogoop already has a comparision table. I just made a refrence to that for the time being. New projects are being added to the applications.html all the time as well. This task is pretty much done.
