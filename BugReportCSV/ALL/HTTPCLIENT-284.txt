Updates to connectionStaleCheckingEnabled docs.
Comments from Itai Brickner In the Threading section of the UserGuide http jakarta.apache.org commons httpclient threading.html There is no mentioning of the setConnectionStaleCheckingEnabled I also felt that it wasn t clear from the APIDOC http jakarta.apache.org commons httpclient apidocs org apache commons httpclient MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.html that staleCheckingEnabled will cause a stale connection to be reconnected by the MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager thanks ItaiCreated an attachment id 8660 Minor doc enhancements. If there are no objections I will go ahead and apply this patch. MikeGo for it OlegPatch applied. Mike
