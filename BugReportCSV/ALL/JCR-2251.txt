WorkspaceManager.dispose should wait until change feed thread is stopped
The WorkspaceManager currently only interrupts the change feed thread but does not wait until it stops.Proposed change. 1 for the patchApplied patch in revision 802765i get non terminating tests in jackrabbit-spi2jcr which eventually end in java.lang.OutOfMemoryError Java heap space. i see loads of ChangePolling threads. i assume the listeners.notify got forgotten in the removeEventListener after increasing the heap size to 256m the tests run in 21 with no problems. the notify mentioned above is not needed.
