NamespaceRegistryTest.testRegisterNamespace test assumptions
NamespaceRegistryTest.testRegisterNamespace makes the assumption that it is possible to create arbitrarily nodes inside the root folder. This is not required to be the case. Proposal - get the name of the test node from the config and - use a property rather than a child node for the test as far as I can tell many repositories will not allow node names in namespaces other than the empty one . Modified proposal when creating a child node fails try a property instead. This requires no new config and let s my implementation pass this test. Fixed with revision 568259. Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 577852.
