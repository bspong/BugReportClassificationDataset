DisjunctionMaxScorer allocates 2 arrays per scored doc
It has this Override public float score throws IOException int doc subScorers 0 .docID float sum subScorers 0 .score max sum 0 int size numScorers scoreAll 1 size doc sum max scoreAll 2 size doc sum max return max 0 sum 0 - max 0 tieBreakerMultiplier They are thread-private arrays so possibly likely JVM can optimize this case allocate only on the stack but still I think instead it should have private instance vars for the score max. Simple patch... I ll commit shortly. Bulk close for 3.1
