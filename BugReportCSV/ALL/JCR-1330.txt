repository.xml DTD doesn t allow element
The repository.xml DTD at http jackrabbit.apache.org dtd repository-1.4.dtd conflicts with the instructions in the wiki page at http wiki.apache.org jackrabbit DataStore Adding the DataStore element as specified in the wiki page violates the DTD. proposed repository-1.4.dtd file that includes the DataStore element definitionShouldn t the org.jackrabbit.useDataStore system property be documented in the wiki too Because although in RepositoryImpl s constructor it is asserted true in case the data store config is not null in InternalValue it s used regardless of the case. So if the data store is not configured but the property is true which is it s default value then the processing in InternalValue is wrong. IMHO this property should be removed altogether. RegardsHi Esteban The system property org.jackrabbit.useDataStore is a kill switch to disable the new code in InternalValue and do everything as before not using BLOBInMemory and so on . This property should never be switched off except if there is a problem with the data store and you want to check if the new code is to blame. I don t think it is needed any longer I will remove this property and the old code in the trunk.DTD committed in revision 614128 trunk and 614129 branch 1.4 .I just saw there is a second dtd file in jackrabbit-core src main resources org apache jackrabbit core config repository-1.4.dtd that has not been changed. Also the file http jackrabbit.apache.org dtd repository-1.4.dtd is not updated yetCommitted in revision 637936 to jackrabbit-core commit 614128 was in jackrabbit-site Merged the jackrabbit-core change to the 1.4 branch in revision 638056.The updated file is now on http jackrabbit.apache.org
