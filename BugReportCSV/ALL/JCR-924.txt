Use the Jackrabbit RMI extensions by default in jackrabbit-webapp
Using the Jackrabbit RMI extensions by default in jackrabbit-webapp Ref http www.nabble.com Custom-node-types-with-RMI-tf3728625.html Thanks for raising the issue I ll take care of this.Fixed in revision 538310. See the Subversion Commits for a link to the changes and a patch that you can apply also to the Jackrabbit 1.3 sources.hi i tried to deploy the jackrabbit war checkout from 20.6.07 and updated on 26.6.07 which failed. as soon as i disabled RMI in bootstrap.properties rmi.enabled false i got redirected to the setup configuration page again. after that modification i could happily use the webapp again. could you please check if this problem is related to your changes regarding RMI default thanks angelaTested on Tomcat 6 with both RMI enabled and disabled.
