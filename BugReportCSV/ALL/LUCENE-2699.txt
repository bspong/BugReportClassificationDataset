Update StandardTokenizer and UAX29Tokenizer to Unicode 6.0.0
Newly released Unicode 6.0.0 contains some character property changes from the previous release 5.2.0 that affect word segmentation UAX 29 and JFlex 1.5.0-SNAPSHOT now supports Unicode 6.0.0 so Lucene s UAX 29-based tokenizers should be updated accordingly. Note that the UAX 29 word break rules themselves did not change between Unicode versions 5.2.0 and 6.0.0. Patch upgrading UAX 29-based tokenizers to Unicode 6.0.0. 1 does the minimal jflex revision need to be bumped currently r591 in READ BEFORE REGENERATING.txt Yes it should be bumped to r597. I post a patch including that shortly. Thanks for the review Robert. In this version of the patch I bumped the minimum JFlex trunk revision in READ BEFORE REGENERATING.txt to 597. Also added a CHANGES.txt entry. This version of the patch fixes mixed end-of-lines present in the previous versions - I installed http www.apache.org dev svn-eol-style.txt - thanks Robert The previous patches were generated on WinVista under Cygwin using a native Windows client SlikSVN Ð apparently that isn t a good idea - mixed end-of-line styles run rampant and rampant whatever it is can t be good . This version of the patch really doesn t have mixed end-of-line styles. I used the Cygwin svn client this time and all end-of-lines are LF. I plan on committing shortly. Committed trunk revision 1022826 branch 3x revision 1022831 Bulk close for 3.1
