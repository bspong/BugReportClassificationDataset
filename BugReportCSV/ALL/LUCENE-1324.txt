TokenFilter should implement reset 
TokenFilter maintains a private member of TokenStream. It should implement reset and call its member TokenStream s reset method. Otherwise that TokenStream never gets reset. Patch applied. Patch which implements reset in TokenFilter I just committed this. Thanks Shai
