CheckIndex prints wrong version number on 3.1 indexes and posibly also in trunk 
When you run CheckIndex on an index created updated with 3.1 it prints about the SegmentInfos Segments file segments g19 numSegments 5 version -11 Lucene 1.3 or prior We should fix CheckIndex and also verify other cases where version numbers are printed out. In trunk the issue may be more complicated Here the patch. In 3.1 we had actually two new version decrements in the format integer. New patch handle preliminary 3.1 version exactly like 2.9 did it throw exception if somebody fails to upgrade this tool will be hit in trunk when this patch is merged Thanks for adding the check to prevent this from ever biting us again... if someone bumps this version and doesnt properly update CheckIndex tests will fail I like this Committed 3.x revision 1079381 Committed 3.1 revision 1079382 Committed trunk revision 1079386 Bulk close for 3.1
