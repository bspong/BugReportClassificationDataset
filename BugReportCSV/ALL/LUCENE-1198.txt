Exception in DocumentsWriter.ThreadState.init leads to corruption
If an exception is hit in the init method DocumentsWriter incorrectly increments numDocsInRAM when in fact the document is not added. Spinoff of this thread http markmail.org message e76hgkgldxhakuaa The root cause that led to the exception in init was actually due to incorrect use of Lucene s APIs one thread still modifying the Document while IndexWriter.addDocument is adding it but still we should protect against any exceptions coming out of init. Attached patch. I added a unit test showing the issue. To do this I added this method to IndexWriter boolean testPoint String name Then in DocumentsWriter.ThreadState.init I added this assert writer.testPoint DocumentsWriter.ThreadState.init start Then tests can subclass IndexWriter and do interesting things at each of these test points. We can add further test points over time... Then I fixed the issue and the tests all tests pass. I ll commit in a day or two. targeted for 2.3.2 bug fix release
