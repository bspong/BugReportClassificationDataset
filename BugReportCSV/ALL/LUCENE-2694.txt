MTQ rewrite weight scorer init should be single pass
Spinoff of LUCENE-2690 see the hacked patch on that issue ... Once we fix MTQ rewrite to be per-segment we should take it further and make weight scorer init also run in the same single pass as rewrite. I started on this issue with a rough idea and wanna upload it to get some initial feedback. The idea is to provide access to TermState via the TermsEnum Attribute API to eventually use the TermState inside of TermQuery to prevent a second lookup as well as term cache. Its very rough and I tried to go the least intrusive way as possible so the implementation is mainly to show the main principles. feedback welcome. Havent looked closely into the patch still need to understand the whole thing just some comments from attribute policeman in general The TermStateAttributeImpl.copyTo should throw ClassCastEx if attributes are not conform compare other impls so the if statement should not be there. AttributeSource takes care of copying. This is not used but for completeness. the convenience addClause method in abstract base class should be final Else you could incorrectly override the wrong one. We already have code duplication in your patch because of this. When you make it final you will see why is the attribute using a SetOnce Attributes generally should be modifiable multiple times. Now you have to call clear first. This may change in future when we have set-once attributes but for now that violates the contract Is the docFreq no already part of the state so TermCollectingRewrite does not need to expose it separately What happens in the term collectors when the same term with different states are merged in the PQ TermsHash ... I would rather not use an attribute here Ð this is a very core thing so I think we should extend TermsEnum API. We can just add a getTermState and a seek TermState to terms enum and actually remove cacheTermState Also then we wouldn t need to add the get docs positions enum methods to TermState. Uwe I agree with your comments - I just didn t pay lots of attention to it since I was rather interested in feedback for the idea.... I actually think that we should move the getTermState into the termsEnum though rather than using an attribute but for now that was easier to implement though. What happens in the term collectors when the same term with different states are merged in the PQ TermsHash ... That one should work since I map the TermState per reader in a PerReaderTermState though. simon We can just add a getTermState and a seek TermState to terms enum and actually remove cacheTermState Yes please - i used the attribute to move faster here since it didn t require to change the API really. Also then we wouldn t need to add the get docs positions enum methods to TermState. yeah see above.... i will workout a cleaner patch next iteration. This patch removes the term cache completely and exposes getTermState via TermsEnum. Terms TermsEnum and IndexReader can now obtain a DocEnum directly by passing in a TermState. I need to run some benchmarks on an index with several segments on a index with two segments its just slightly faster... mike do you have one ready Phew that was fast Wow you nuked the terms dict cache Nice Though it makes me a bit nervous... like there ll always be a risk we ve missed some path through Lucene that does two lookups... And even for external reasons eg same query arrives to Lucene looking for next page or something the cache is useful. EG a straight TermQuery not spawned by MTQ is now hitting the terms dict twice. Once inside Sim.idfExplain where it calls searcher.docFreq term and then again to pull the scorers per sub reader. Probably TermQuery should pull the PerReaderTermState up front if it wasn t already handed it And then pass the docFreq to Sim.idfExplain. Should we add a PerReaderTermState.docFreq which just sums up across all subs Does TermState really need field Seems wasteful to have to store that... eg an MTQ will store many TermStates against the same field. I think we should keep TermState lean. Also I think it shouldn t need that clone method I think instead of duplicating docs docsAndPositions and soon bulkPostings on TermsEnum once for TermState and once without we should just add a seek TermState And then the single docs docsAndPositions etc. method can be used to get the enum for that term. Likewise for Terms Also we should remove docFreq and ord from TermsEnum since you should get it from TermState I think IndexReader can offer the sugar methods that take either BytesRef term or String field TermState state . Also I tried to run the benchmark on beast but unfortunately there s a bug somewhere even though Lucene core tests pass Ð I see different results for some fuzzy queries. Nice work Getting to single term lookup for all queries will be awesome BTW one use case where this patch should show a sizable performance gain is a primary key lookup against a multi-segment index. So this d be a TermQuery against eg an id field where the app knows at most one doc contains the requested value. Today we pay a high price for the 2nd pass because we do not cache a miss against a segment. So on the first pass computing IDF we know which segment has a match and which segments do not but then on the 2nd pass we re-pay the lookup cost against all the misses the single segment w the hit will be cached . So this ought to be a big win... especially once we combine this w the speedups from pulsing codec we still need to cutover to this as a default then primary key lookups in a Lucene index will be much faster... Attaching current state - all test pass for me and luceneutils brings consistent results with trunk.

Fuzzy only expands to 50 terms so that might no be very meaningful. I re-added the TermCache for this patch though... Will attach more info tomorrow. We shouldn t lose the clone optimization in StandardPostingsReader... the class is final so it should use copy instead of calling super.clone This is important for -client. FYI - there is a coding error in the latest patch that causes the TermState to be ignored - TermWeight uses the wrong reference to the PerReaderTermState. I will upload a new patch later this weekend simon here is a new patch. I removed the hacky TermWeight part to make only MTQ single pass for now. Other TermQueries will hit the TermCache for now. No nocommit left. Currently there is some duplication unncessary classes in the TermState hierarchy - that needs cleanup. BTW. I see some highlighter test failing - will look into this later... simon If I force scoring BQ rewrite for wildcard prefix queries ie set that rewrite mode and then relax BQ max clause count I see healthy speedups 23-27 for these queries Great While this doesn t happen w our default settings ie these queries quickly cutover to constant filter rewrite apps that change these defaults will see a gain plus the term cache which today protects you is terribly fragile since apps w many MTQ queries in flight can thrash that cache thus killing performance. This patch prevents that entirely since MTQs do their own caching of the TermStates they need awesome. I love seeing cacheCurrentTerm removed OK I think we are close A bunch of smallish things I think we should remove TermsEnum.docFreq and .ord Ie replace with .termState .docFreq and .ord At first I was thinking we should merge up TermStateBase into TermState but actually there are cases eg PulsingCodec which where you want the separation. Maybe rename TermStateBase - PrefixCodedTermState Ie this is really the TermState impl used by any codec using PrefixCodedTerms EG the fact that it stores the filePointer into a X.tis file is particular to it... Maybe rename MockTermState - BasicTermState At first I was thinking the codec should return null if it cannot seek by TermState... I generally don t like mock returns that hide lose information... but then it s convenient to always have something to hold the docFreq for the term to avoid lots of special cased code... so I think it s OK We lost the clone using new in StandardTermState... Maybe revert changes to AppendingCodec Ie let it pass its terms dict cache size again I wonder if we can somehow make PerReaderTermState use an array keyed by sub reader index instead... seems like a new HashMap per Term in an MTQ could be heavy. It s tricky because we don t store enough information ie to quickly map parent reader sub reader - sub index . But I don t think this should hold up committing... since our defaults don t typically allow for that many terms in-flight it should be fine... It s a little spooky the TermQuery.scorer calls .take destructive eg it means if you ask for scorer again on same reader you get diff t behavior Can we make that a .get instead of .take This may also bite us if we use diff t threads to score each segment ie suddenly this .take must be thread safe . In fact same deal w nulling out the TQ.perReaderTermState The comment on top of TermStateByteStart looks wrong Small whitespace issue Ð missing space on if . Also our generics are not supposed to have whitespace inside eg we shouldn t have the space in new DoubleBarrelLRUCache FieldAndTerm TermStateBase termsCacheSize I think the TQ ctor that takes both docFreq and states can drop the docFreq Ie it can ask the states for it I have also some things We currently don t support seeking a FilteredTermsEnum this is disallowed by UnsupportedOperationException we may change this but its complicated Robert and me are thinking about it but for now its disallowed as it would break the enum logic . So the TermState seek method in FilteredTermsEnum should also throw UOE This enum does not support seeking throws UnsupportedOperationException Override public SeekStatus seek BytesRef term boolean useCache throws IOException throw new UnsupportedOperationException getClass .getName does not support seeking Additionally can the next implementation in FilteredTermsEnum use TermState It does lots of seeking on the underlying filtered TermsEnum. This is the reason why sekking on the FilteredTermsEnum is not allowed. Filtering is done here on the accept methods. For what is setNextReader in TermCollector I don t like that but you seems to need it for the PerReaderTermState. The collector should really only work on the enum not on any reader. At least the Thats what I have seen on first patch review will now apply patch and look closer into it But the first point is important FilteredTermsEnum currently should not support seeking. Here just the patch for a correct behaving FilteredTermsEnum according to docs that it does currently not support seeking . The assert is also not needed as tenum is guranteed to be not null its final and ctor already asserts this I think we should remove TermsEnum.docFreq and .ord Ie replace with .termState .docFreq and .ord I disagree on that - at least docFreq is an essential part of the API and we should not force TermState creation just to get the df. Yet TermState is an expert API you should not need to pull an expert API to get something essential like df. I would leave those as they are or only pull ord into TermState. Maybe rename TermStateBase - PrefixCodedTermState Ie this is really the TermState impl used by any codec using PrefixCodedTerms EG the fact that it stores the filePointer into a X.tis file is particular to it.. Yeah that sounds reasonable. Maybe rename MockTermState - BasicTermState At first I was thinking the codec should return null if it cannot seek by TermState... I generally don t like mock returns that hide lose information... but then it s convenient to always have something to hold the docFreq for the term to avoid lots of special cased code... so I think it s OK I think we can get rid of it entirely. We can use TermStateBase for it and let PrefixCodedTermState just add the pointer though. That way we get rid of it nicely. I would like to keep that api as it is since it makes the usage easier especially in the rewrite methods.. We lost the clone using new in StandardTermState... I don t get that really - IMO this is quite minor but I will look into it again... Maybe revert changes to AppendingCodec Ie let it pass its terms dict cache size again unintentional - will fix wonder if we can somehow make PerReaderTermState use an array keyed by sub reader index instead... seems like a new HashMap per Term in an MTQ could be heavy. It s tricky because we don t store enough information ie to quickly map parent reader sub reader - sub index . But I don t think this should hold up committing... since our defaults don t typically allow for that many terms in-flight it should be fine... I actually had this in a very similar way. I used a custom linked list and relied on the fact that the incoming reader are applied in the same order and skipped until the next reader with that term appeared. I changed that back to Map impl to make it simpler since I didn t see speedups - well this was caused by a very nifty coding error i think I have that patch around somewhere is the history... lets see.. I think the TQ ctor that takes both docFreq and states can drop the docFreq Ie it can ask the states for it yeah sure - well the patch is my current state since I had to drop everything and leave on friday... I clean up an upload a new patch early this week Uwe I will incorporate your fix - thanks I would leave those as they are or only pull ord into TermState. I agree about docfreq but ord should go. Ord should be in e.g. StandardTermState but not in TermState nor TermsEnum. This is an implementation detail for our current terms dictionary and its silly how we just throw UOE for other codecs Its codec-specific. Other terms implementations might have something like an ord but it definitely might not even be a long Within StandardCodec etc this creates no problem as it still has access to it. If we find ourselves wanting needing to use ord outside of Standard we should ask ourselves why this is and instead fix the APIs to not depend on some codec-specific long value.

Yet TermState is an expert API you should not need to pull an expert API to get something essential like df. I would leave those as they are or only pull ord into TermState. OK I agree let s leave at least dF directly in TermsEnum. Calling .termState presumably entails a clone right Ie the returned object is guaranteed private So that s a good reason not to require it... I actually had this in a very similar way. I used a custom linked list and relied on the fact that the incoming reader are applied in the same order and skipped until the next reader with that term appeared. I changed that back to Map impl to make it simpler since I didn t see speedups - well this was caused by a very nifty coding error Let s just stick w map for now I think Progress not perfection here is a new patch with a slightly different implementation of PerReaderTermState. I build a view from the subreader used to build the MTQ which is shared across all PerReaderTermState instance for the query. The PrTS then uses only the ordinal from the ReaderView to reference a TermState which prevents us from creating Map instances for each term. In turn this also made it possible to fall back to re-seeking the TermDict if the reader is not in the view. I fixed all other issues and all tests including the highlighter pass now. mike - do you mind if I take this simon mike - do you mind if I take this Of course not Please take it Patch looks awesome Really ord support is a function of the terms dict impl not the codec well indirectly codec has ord support if its terms dict impl does . PrefixCodedTermsDict in turn supports ord only if its terms index does. Can we move TermStateBase now under codecs.standard up into codecs and rename it to PrefixCodedTermState Ie it s awkward that PrefixCodedTermsReader a terms dict impl shared across many codecs is reaching into standard codec to get its TermState impl. Then the private static class in StandardPostingsReader can be renamed to StandardTermState I like this new ReaderView I think it can be more generally useful outside of PerReaderTermState eg Filter Collector could receive this so that they can map sub reader to context in parent. But let s leave that for another day. Still some small whitespace issues eg if OK I tested perf on 10 M wiki index multi-segment no deletes. For the test I unnaturally forced Prefix Wildcard queries to always use scoring BQ rewrite and upped the BQ max clause count way high to force testing of TermState.

Then the private static class in StandardPostingsReader can be renamed to StandardTermState done - that makes sense Still some small whitespace issues eg if done I think we are close I think instead of ReaderView we could change Weight.scorer API so that instead of receiving IndexReader reader it receives a struct that has parent reader sub reader ord of that sub It s easy to be back compat because we could just forward to prior scorer method with only the sub I think instead of ReaderView we could change Weight.scorer API so that instead of receiving IndexReader reader it receives a struct that has parent reader sub reader ord of that sub It s easy to be back compat because we could just forward to prior scorer method with only the sub Mike I am not sure if that helps us here. If you use this method you can not disambiguate between the set of readers that where used to create the PerReaderTermState and the once that have a certain ord assigned to it. Disambiguation would be more difficult if we do that. IMO sharing a ReaderView seems to be the best solution so far. I don t think we should bind it to an IR directly since users can easily build a ReaderView from a Composite Reader. Yet for searching it would be nice to have a ReaderView on Seacher IndexSearcher which can be triggered upon weight creation. That way we can also disambiguate between PerReaderTermState given to the TermQuery ctor when we create the weight so that if the view doesn t match we either create a new PerReaderTermState or just don t use it for this weight. I thought about TermsEnum ord again. I don t think we should really add it back though. Its really an implementation detail and folks that wanna use it should be aware of that and cast correctly. On the other hand I don t like to have the seek ord in TermsEnum either if we remove ord . I think we should remove it from the interface entirely though. simon I think instead of ReaderView we could change Weight.scorer API so that instead of receiving IndexReader reader it receives a struct that has parent reader sub reader ord of that sub so I changed the Weight scorer API to use a class called ScoreContext that holds the parent reader the current sub and the subs ord. That change is absolutely massive I don t upload that change since I think if we do that we need to do it in a different issue anyway. I ran into a couple of problems if we pass in such a context we also need to change the explain interface since its calling Weight scorer here and there Once we pass in the Context stuff like QueryWrapperFilter doesn t work anymore since it doesn t know which ord the incoming reader has. So Filters would need a context too. I don t like that Stuff like scoreDocsInOrder are hard to put into such a context since almost all scorers internally are called with scoreDocsInOrder true with a contant. meaning that nobody really respects the incoming value for subscorers though. but if i just forward the context the member needs to be set to true or the context needs to be cloned for subs - see BooleanQuery for instance. such a context would somehow enforce that MTQ are only executed against the Reader they where rewritten against. Which is how it should be IMO but we are also depending on that everybody who uses a MTQ knows exactly how the query was rewritten which is kind of not obvious. I think we need a better way to enforce stuff like that. after all I think this must be done in a different issue though. This issue was meant to make MTQ single pass so lets do that first.... progress over perfection ey mike . Nonetheless it seems like that we need to rethink the Weight API entirely I also don t like that Weight operates on Searcher instead of IndexSearcher though. after all I think this must be done in a different issue though 1 If when we now pass a naked IndexReader eg to Weight.scorer Weight.explain Filter.getDocIdSet we replace that with a ReaderContext which has reader its parent and its ord then this precursor makes both TermState this issue and the awesome PK speedup LUCENE-2829 much simpler. And I agree we should break it out as its own issue. It s good to do that as its own issue since that s a rote API cutover Ð we are passing a struct instead of a naked reader but otherwise no change. This also lets us solve cases where the Filter needs the full context eg LUCENE-2348. Also with this I think we should sharpen in the jdocs that when you call Query.rewrite the returned query must be searched only against he same reader you rewrote against. Similarly when you create a Weight it should only be used against the same Searcher used to create it from a Query. Another iteration on this after LUCENE-2831 was committed last week. updated to trunk all test pass re-added all ord related stuff back to TermsEnum since I think we should decouple this and solve it in a different issue. There is already enough changes in here and discussions should be focused on making MTQ single pass. Changed IndexSearcher to run concurrent searches on a leaf slice rather than on a leaf converted to a Top-Level Context. That made the callables a bit simpler and is more consistent since the hierarchy is preserved. TermState is now referenced by leaf ordinal and asserted using the leaf s top-level ctx. TermQuery is not single pass for all queries while state is only hold in Weight unless PerReaderTermState as not set. But even then the top-level ctx must be identical to the given IS s top-level ctx otherwise the give PerReaderTermState is not used. this one seems pretty close One question I m look at the definition of TermState Holds all state required for link TermsEnum to produce a link DocsEnum without re-seeking the terms dict. So why do we have seek BytesRef TermState shouldnt it just be seek Termstate I think its confusing it takes an unnecessary bytes parameter. here s a hack patch dont think it actually works just showing what i mean. I think termsenum should only have seek TermState . in the hack-patch i made the termState and seekTermState non-abstract the default impl returns a SimpleTermState containing the term bytes and saved docFreq and implements seek TermState with those bytes. This is basically what the patch had everywhere anyway as an implementation for many of these we should use more efficient impls i fixed this for MemoryIndex as an example but MultiTermsEnum comes to mind . Also i don t understand what was going on with setting bytes on the DeltaBytesReader with your seek BytesRef TermState before. If StandardCodec needs to know the shared byte prefix or something like that to reposition the enum then it should put this in its termstate. Next iteration. I took roberts patch and cleaned up a few things and added a new OrdTermState that can be used for instanceof testing and thoughout all TermsEnum that use ord primarily. I also removed the docFreq getter from TermState since its really an impl. detail. The downside of this patch is that PrefixCodedTermState is kind of heavyweight now since it carries the BytesRef to re-init the DeltaBytesReader but I didn t see another way to fix this right now. The failure in TestFSTs is because PrefixCodedTermsReader is somehow returning an OrdTermState when its terms index var gap does not support ord. The ord member of PrefixCodedTermState is undefined when the terms dict doesn t support ord ie when ord throws UOE . So to fix this we should fix TestFSTs to go back to calling .ord and catching the UOE maybe Separately make sure you don t overwrite storeOrds in that test. Ie the test randomly sets it to true or false so that we test both cases only if the terms index cannot suppord ord should we wire it to false. If it can support ord then we should leave it as the random value... fixed the TestFST - thanks mike for looking into that and updated to trunk This patch changes TermsEnum seek TermState back to TermsEnum seek BytesRef TermState . Yet TermState is opaque now and TermsEnum has a default impl for TermsEnum seek BytesRef TermState . Holding the BytesRef in TermState for our PrefixCoded based codecs seems way too costly though. seems like this time perf rules out purity in the interface. seems like this time perf rules out purity in the interface. I know i didn t like this aspect of the patch but I am ok with it for now as long as we keep things experimental and try to keep an eye on improving the purity of TermsEnum a bit. we are making a lot of progress on the terms handling with flexible indexing and i could easily see more interesting implementations being available other than just PrefixCoded... In some ideal world I guess i d prefer if TermsEnum was an attributesource with seek and next FilteredTermsEnum was like tokenFilter and TermState was just captureState restoreState... but I agree we should just lean towards whatever works for now. definitely like it better now that things such as docFreq are pulled out of termstate and its completely opaque i think this is the right way to go.
