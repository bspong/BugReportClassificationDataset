Item.isNew does not work correctly within a transaction
javadoc on Item.isNew states       Returns code true code if this is a new item meaning that it exists only in transient       storage on the code Session code and has not yet been saved. Within a transaction       code isNew code on an code Item code may return code false code because the item       has been saved even if that code Item code is not in persistent storage because the       transaction has not yet been committed . but currently Item.isNew returns true after beeing saved in a transaction.Node.isCheckedOut returns true for a new item. due to the issue described in JCR-237 this is a problem within transactions.corrected Item.isNew method by relying on the transient overlaid state. this corrupted the locking related methods when running inside a transaction. added an iterim method ItemImpl.isTransactionalNew using the old behaviour. as soon locking is tx aware this method can be removed.
