Add ability to run backwards-compatibility tests automatically
This is an idea Doug mentioned on LUCENE-1422. This patch adds new targets to build.xml to automatically download the junit tests from a previous Lucene release and run them against the current core. Execute tests like this ant -Dtag lucene 2 4 0 test-tag It will create a new directory tags lucene 2 4 0 and fetch the tests from the svn repository and run them. Here s the patch. It adds the targets test-tag and clean-tags . In common-build.xml I added test-macro and compile-test-macro that are shared between the standard test and new test-tag targets. Currently all tests from Lucene 2.4 pass with trunk. Committed revision 712416.
