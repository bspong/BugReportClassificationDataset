TermVectors index files can become corrupt when autoCommit false
Spinoff from this thread http www.gossamer-threads.com lists lucene java-dev 55951 There are actually 2 separate cases here both only happening when autoCommit false First issue was caused by LUCENE-843 sigh if you add a bunch of docs with no term vectors such that 1 or more flushes happen then you add docs that do have term vectors the tvx file will not have enough entries corruption . Second issue was caused by bulk merging of term vectors LUCENE-1120 Ð only in trunk and bulk merging of stored fields LUCENE-1043 in 2.3 and only shows when autoCommit false and the bulk merging optimization runs. In this case the code that reads the rawDocs tries to read too far in the tvx fdx files it s not really index corruption but rather a bug in the rawDocs reading . Patch attached. I added the original test case as a unit test plus 2 other tests. The fixes themselves are trivial a few lines . I plan to commit end of today. Thanks for finding reporting this Suresh Backported to 2.3 branch.
