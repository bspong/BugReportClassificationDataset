backport suggest module to branch 3.x
It would be nice to develop a plan to expose the autosuggest functionality to Lucene users in 3.x There are some complications such as seeing if we can backport the FST-based functionality which might require a good bit of work. But I think this would be well-worth it. if we can backport the FST-based functionality 1 heres an svn diff from my merge for whatever use that is . This also backports SOLR-2378 the FST suggester I plan to commit shortly. Committed revision 1130612 bulk close for 3.3
