Tests need to clean up after themselves
I havent run ant clean for a while. The randomly generated temporarily file names just piled up from running the tests many times... so ant clean is still running after quite a long time. We should take the logic in the base solr test cases and push it into LuceneTestCase so a test cleans up all its temporary stuff. I d like to fix this one but our tests were always kinda messy this way. They have improved and we could do this on a future release I think... it doesn t affect hudson as it does a ant clean and we have been living with this for a while. not the most elegant solution but it does the trick. i plan to commit this shortly. things can be made more elegant later. Committed revisions 1095937 trunk 1095939 branch 3x 1095940 backwards I merged RT with trunk so hudson builds should be fine there too Bulk closing for 3.2
