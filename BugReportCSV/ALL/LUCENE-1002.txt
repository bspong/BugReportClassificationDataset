Nightly Builds
Nightly builds for Lucene are HUGE due to the inclusion of the contrib benchmark temp and work directories. These directories should be excluded. It also seems the nightly build is not including the binary build OK I got the src builds to be a more reasonable size by excluding contrib benchmark temp and work. Now need to get clover and the binary builds working again http www.gossamer-threads.com lists lucene java-dev 53115 From the sounds of it Clover should work once DocumentWriter is fully removed. I will verify this. http www.gossamer-threads.com lists lucene java-dev 53114 Grant one other thing i just noticed the recent failed builds seem to have failed when running tests but there is no Test Results link showing up in Hudson to see what the failures are.
