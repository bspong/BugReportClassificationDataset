Tablespace Filegroup support for MS SQL Server
Tablespace support was added for Oracle database servers in this issue https issues.apache.org jira browse JCR-968 We would like tablespace or filegroup support for MS SQL Server as well. To address this we have created a patch using the trunk of JackRabbit that closely follows the patch in the above named issue.This patch needs the patch from the linked issue for Oracle to be applied first.Modified New source files in entirety for addressing this issue. Note that the patch included in the linked issue need to be applied first.This issue requires that patch in JCR-968 to be applied first. It is similar to JCR-968 but adds the same support for MS SQL Server.I committed a partial and slightly modified version of the patch in revision 610214. The committed version only contains the bundle persistence and journal changes. I dropped the db persistence and file system changes since they didn t compile createSchemaSql vs. getSchemaDDL etc. . Also as of Jackrabbit 1.4 I would recommend people to use bundle persistence over db persistence and to disable useExternalBlobs over using a database file system. Thus I don t think it s necessarily even worthwhile implementing tablespace support for those features. Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 610219 for inclusion in the Jackrabbit 1.4 release. Thanks for the contribution I will recheck the file system changes. As for the changes in db persistence we are at present using db persistence over bundle persistence since bundle persistence does not provide a method to override how a connection is obtained and we have a need to route connection requests through our internal code which provides connection pooling etc .
