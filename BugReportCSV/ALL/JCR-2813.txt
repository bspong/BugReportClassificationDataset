 overwriting cached entry warnings
when using multiple concurrent sessions you ll find lots of log entries like     03.11.2010 21 17 03 WARN ItemStateReferenceCache overwriting cached entry ad79ca57-5eb1-4b7d-a439-a9fd73cc8c5a ItemStateReferenceCache.java line 176 those are actually legitimate warnings since there s a siginificant risk of data loss inconsistency involved. this is apparently a regression of changes introduced by JCR-2699 specifically svn r1004223partially reverted changes of svn r1004223 New Revision 1036117In revision 1038201 I added a mechanism that avoids the big synchronization block but still makes sure that no two threads can concurrently load the same item.Merged to the 2.1 branch in revision 1038599.... and merged to the 2.0 branch in revision 1038609. In revision 1038201 I added a mechanism that avoids the big synchronization block but still makes sure that no two threads can concurrently load the same item. excellent thanks
