import must not ignore xml prefixed attributes
XML import currently ignores attributes that are in the xml namespace. e.g. DocViewImportHandler s startElement                 if atts.getQName i .startsWith xml                      skipping xml space xml lang etc.                     log.debug skipping reserved system attribute atts.getQName i                     continue                  That is a significant loss of information since xml base xml lang and xml id attributes are critical to the content. We should register the xml prefix as a reserved namespace not needing an xmlns declaration and then treat it like any other attribute. Here are some useful XML examples http xformsinstitute.com essentials browse ch03s02.php http www.zvon.org HowTo Output http www.w3.org Math testsuite testsuite TortureTests Complexity complex1.xml http intertwingly.net wiki pie EchoExample http support.sas.com onlinedoc 913 getDoc en engxml.hlp a002973381.htm That is a significant loss of information since xml base xml lang and xml id attributes are critical to the content. We should register the xml prefix as a reserved namespace not needing an xmlns declaration and then treat it like any other attribute. i agree that those attributes need to be handled however registering the xml prefix as a reserved namespace alone would IMO not solve the issue but introduce further problems. if e.g. xml lang would be a legal property name and therefore xml a legal prefix in JCR users could be e.g. tempted to use names such as xml data xml foo etc. those in turn would be illegal in the Document View XML representation http www.w3.org TR xml-names11 xmlReserved . i think that this is a specification issue. the specification should be clear about how the reserved attributes xml base xml lang etc are handled on Document View XML import. also the handling of the xml namespace should be clearly defined. reassigning to peeter fixed in spec.fixed in rev. 158098 anticipating related spec change in 0.16.4closing resolved issue
