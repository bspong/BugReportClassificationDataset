Allow whitespaces in base64 encoded binary fields of XML import files
When importing files using Session.importXML the Binary property values are Base64 encoded. However you cannot put whitespaces in them and XML files with binaries in them become very long lines. The files are more manageable if whilespaces could be put in them as is common to do in base base64 encoded files.This is a very simple but effective way just to strip out whitespaces before the actual import of the Binary properties. Patch against trunk revision 1023682 but equally applicable to 2.1 or earlier versions. An even simpler and more general fix is to modify the Base64 utility class to ignore whitespace characters. Done in revision 1039423.Merged to the 2.1 branch in revision 1040130.
