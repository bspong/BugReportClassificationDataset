change jdk icu collation to use byte 
Now that term is byte we should switch collation to use byte instead of indexablebinarystring . This is faster and results in much smaller sort keys. I figure we can work it out here and fix termrangequery to use byte in parallel but we can already test sorting etc now. attached is a quick prototype. I kept the old representation working via Version. if you use 4.0 it just encodes to byte. I figure this has enough violations that Uwe will jump in and help Updated patch with javadocs and attributefactory violations corrected. I think this patch is ready but we should probably fix a few things TermRangeQuery QueryParser should consume with BytesRef not string first. I looked at some of the keys in the test code and encoding directly as byte results in keys nearly 1 2 the size in bytes of the previous encoding. Committed revision 1075210.
