The jackrabbit-pool- thread prevents the process from stopping
If the repository is not closed and a session is still logged in then the process doesn t terminate because of a non-daemon thread named jackrabbit-pool- n . Test case public class TestThreadPreventsExit     public static void main String... a throws Exception         new TransientRepository .login                 new SimpleCredentials new char 0      This program doesn t stop. The non-daemon thread was introduces as part of https issues.apache.org jira browse JCR-2465 The fix is to use a daemon thread.FWIW I think a more proper fix to the this would be to change the test case to new TransientRepository .login ... .logout
