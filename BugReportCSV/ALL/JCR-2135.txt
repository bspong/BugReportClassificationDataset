UserManagement make membership a weakreferences
the 2.0 user management code still contains a TODO asking for changing group-membership from reference to weakreference. now that weakreferences are implemented in jackrabbit-core i d like to make that change both in the node type definitions and the code. i m opening this issue in order to give us the chance to keep track of node type change that may cause troubles....just found out that the retrieval of the groups members doesn t work any more since the changes made.... possible solutions - revert changes made and keep REFERENCES - fix weakrefs or whatever is broken here.... didn t dig into the details yet . fixed by addressing JCR-2166 thanks . rev. 787942 ... in addition fixed issue when removing membership missing weak-ref flag upon value creation ... and use getWeakReferences String instead of getWeakReferences when accessing the references from     the target group .
