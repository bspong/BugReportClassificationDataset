JSR 283 support
Proposed new interface o.a.j.a.jsr.283.Node extending javax.jcr.Node and containining the methods required for shared node functionaility. Q is it OK to copy over the Javadoc from JSR-283 added o.a.j.api.jsr283.Node containing shareable node functionality with revision 698122.Blocker for Jackrabbit 2.0.In preparation for the switch to JCR 2.0 I ve attached the POM file that can be used with the JCR API jar file found in the JSR 283 proposed final draft PFD . The dependency setting for this jar will be      dependency        groupId javax.jcr groupId        artifactId jcr artifactId        version 2.0-pfd version      dependency This jar is not available on the central Maven repository so you ll need to install it manually to your local repository. To do that download the JSR 283 PFD package and the POM file attached here and install them with the following command     mvn install install-file -Dfile path to lib jcr-2.0.jar -DpomFile path to pom.xml Attached an updated version of the JCR 2.0 API jar jcr-2.0-b15.jar . This version fixes some issues reported against the PFD version and is expected to better match the upcoming final jcr-2.0.jar. The b15 version number is based on internal version control and will change for any further updates we need to do. We should update Jackrabbit to use this API jar instead of the earlier PFD version. I ve also included a POM file jcr-2.0-b15.jar to be used when uploading the API jar to your local Maven repository. It should replace the jcr-2.0-pfd.xml POM file we currently have in trunk. Note that the jcr-2.0-b15.jar attached here is explicitly not meant to be included in Jackrabbit svn or Jackrabbit releases. It is made available for evaluation purposes under similar terms as the PFD jar from jcp.org.Attached updated versions of the JCR 2.0 API jar and related POM file.The b16 jar above contained some errors I ve uploaded a fixed version b17. Once I ve updated Jackrabbit trunk to use the latest version I ll remove the previous attachments to avoid confusion.Attached an updated pre-release version of the JCR 2.0 API jar. I ll update the build to use this jar in a moment.Attached another updated version of the JCR 2.0 API jar jcr-2.0-b19.jar and the associated POM file jcr-2.0-b19.xml . Like before you can upload these to your local repository like this     mvn install install-file -Dfile jcr-2.0-b19.jar -DpomFile jcr-2.0-b19.xmlHere s another updated pre-release version b110 of the JCR 2.0 API jar. To use it download the relevant files and upload them to your local Maven repository     mvn install install-file -Dfile jcr-2.0-b110.jar -DpomFile jcr-2.0-b110.xmlBuild updated to use the latest API jar version b110 . I again removed the earlier versions to avoid confusion.Attached updated version of the JCR 2.0 API jar jcr-2.0-b112.jar and the associated POM file jcr-2.0-b112.xml . Like before you can upload these to your local repository like this     mvn install install-file -Dfile jcr-2.0-b112.jar -DpomFile jcr-2.0-b112.xmlAttached a yet another updated version of the JCR 2.0 API jar jcr-2.0-b113.jar and the associated POM file jcr-2.0-b113.xml . Like before you can upload these to your local repository like this     mvn install install-file -Dfile jcr-2.0-b113.jar -DpomFile jcr-2.0-b113.xmlAttached hopefully the latest pre-release version of the JCR 2.0 API jar jcr-2.0-b114.jar and the associated POM file jcr-2.0-b114.xml . You can upload these to your local repository like this     mvn install install-file -Dfile jcr-2.0-b114.jar -DpomFile jcr-2.0-b114.xmlResolving as Fixed As of now we have no known issues regarding JSR 283 feature-completeness. Many thanks to everyone involved in this work
