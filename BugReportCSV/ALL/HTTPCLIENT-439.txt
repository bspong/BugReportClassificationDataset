Auth failed Body Error Access is Denied.When connecting using IE Outlook web access it s able to connect which also uses NTLM authentication.Created an attachment id 14409 Patch take 1 This patch should take care of the problem. Please make sure you do not forget to set the http.protocol.credential-charset parameter to whatever non-ASCII charset you are using. OlegThanks for the immediate response. I added the given patch even then it fails. I am getting 401 status Auth failed Body Error Access is Denied. Username ’–‘Š’–‘Š password ’–‘Š’–‘Š ÊDid you set the parameter http.protocol.credential-charset OlegI did this GetMethod getMethod new GetMethod exchange getMethod.getParams .setCredentialCharset UTF-8 What makes you think the server expects UTF-8 OlegLooks like the right fix to me. MikePatch committed. OlegNTLM was failing as the Exchange server does not support Http authentication with UTF-8 characters in userid and password. It works fine if the character set is latin-1. ISO-8859-1 Thanks for the Help.
