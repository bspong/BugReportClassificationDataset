TimeLimitingCollector s TimeExceededException contains useless relative docid
We found another bug with the RandomIndexWriter When TimeLimitingCollector breaks collection after timeout it records the last next collected docid. It does this without rebasing so the docid is useless. TestTimeLimitingCollector checks the docid but correctly rebases it as only this makes sense . Because the RandomIndexWriter uses different merge settings the index is now sometimes not optimized and so the test fails which is correct as the docid is useless for non-optimized index . Attached is a patch that fixes this. Please tell me if I should backport to 2.9 and 3.0 Committed trunk revision 965299 Committed 3.x revision 965300 Please reopen if we should backport to 2.9 or 3.0 reopening for possible 2.9.4 3.0.3 backport. Committed 3.0 branch revision 1028920 Committed 2.9 branch revision 1028922
