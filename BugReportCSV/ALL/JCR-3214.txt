 Lock weird number for infinite 
 this is a follow-up of JCR-3205 i am surprised by the davex reply to a lock request with infinite timeout before and after the fix from JCR-3205 D timeout Second-2147483 D timeout this number is 2 21 50331 which seems pretty random to me. coincidally this number is exactly 2 31 - 1 2147483647 without the last 3 digits. can it be that there are some weird string operations happening on server side DomUtil.timeoutToXml       Note that link DavConstants INFINITE TIMEOUT is not represented by the String       link DavConstants TIMEOUT INFINITE Infinite defined by RFC 2518 due to a known       issue with Microsoft Office that opens the document read only and       never unlocks the resource if the timeout is missing or Infinite . So what happens is that the servlet internall uses MAX INT as infinite but then doesn t treat is as a special value and also divides by 1000 ms - s . Not sure what s the best fix here do we know whether Office still has this problem Speaking of which as far as I recall Office uses a lock time out of 300s and just was confused when the server did not respect the timeout. Now that the server does respect timeouts the workaround may not be needed anymore.I just tried editing with word and despite it sends a request with Timeout Second-3600 the same time out as above is returned will have a look.OK part of the problem are different code paths DavResourceImpl vs DefaultItemCollection.Merged to the 2.4 branch in revision 1235746.
