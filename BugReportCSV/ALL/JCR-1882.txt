Avoid project.version in dependencies
Another one for Jackrabbit 1.5 we should avoid using project.version for our dependencies and override the versions of any transitive dependencies that use project.version notably the Jetty dependencies in jackrabbit-standalone to avoid problems with Maven 2.0.9 caused by MNG-2339 1 . 1 http jira.codehaus.org browse MNG-2339 Resolving in both trunk and the 1.5 branch.
