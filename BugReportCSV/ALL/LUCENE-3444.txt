Distinct field value count per group
Support a second pass collector that counts unique field values of a field per group. This is just one example of group statistics that one might want. Attached initial version of a second pass collector that counts the unique field values per group for a specific field. Updated patch. I ve split the DistinctCountCollector into abstract base class and a term based implementation. This allows other implementations such as IDV and function based implementations. Updated the patch and added a docvalues based implementation. Things to do Add implementation that uses MutableValue. Add random tests. Added new patch. Updated patch to current trunk. Added random test. Fails now in some cases. Added function mutable value based implementation. It is almost ready to be committed Committed to trunk.
