shouldn t automatically set Content-Length in request header
currently httpclient automatically add Content-Length 0 in the request header this is causing problems with some web servers particularly with ar.atwola.com Try the following URL http ar.atwola.com file adsWrapper.js It will block indefinitely. This problem can be fixed by not sending the Content-Length header this is the browser s behavior. I m not sure why this casue problem but let s conform to a standard browser s practice and avoid troubles.Requests that do not contain a message body probably should not have a Content- length header. My reading of RFC 2616 is that the existence of a Content- Length header implies that there is a message body. The semantics of a message body of length 0 may be debatable but it seems reasonable to me to leave it off.I changed HttpMethodBase.java to leave off the Content-Length header if getRequestContentLength returns 0. HTTPCLIENT-20 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug.
