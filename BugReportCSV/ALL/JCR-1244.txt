No need for NodeReferences in jcr2spi
I happened to come across the org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.state.NodeReferences interface and realized that with the current SPI definitions there s really no need for that abstraction. The PropertyId array returned by NodeInfo.getReferences is quite good enough for jcr2spi without any NodeReferences wrapping around it.Proposed patch 20 lines -122 lines for removing NodeReferences in jackrabbit-jcr2spi.looks good to me. 1fine with me.Patch applied in revision 605155. Thanks for the reviews
