CacheBehaviour Observation broken
While trying to fix JCR-2293 I discovered that CacheBehaviour Observation is broken - HierarchyEventListener.onEvent ignores local event despite the comment saying otherwise . Not sure which way it should be. However with local events being ignored JCR-2293 will most probably also occur with CacheBehaviour Observation. - NodeEntryImpl.refresh Event does not set its child node entries to incomplete when a node property was added. - After tentatively fixing above issues I discovered that NodeEntryImpl.refresh Event and my own event listener operate on different NodeEntryImpl and ChildNodeEntryImpl instances. That is even though I set childNodeEntries.complete to false in NodeEntryImpl.refresh Event when my own event listener retrieves that node entry it gets a different instance which has childNodeEntries.complete still set to true. The 3rd point from my previous comment is invalid. I was mixing up hierarchies from different session. For the first point I think the JavaDoc is out of sync and the actual implementation is tight. After talking to Angela we decided that only the comment needs fixing. Fixed in revision 822272
