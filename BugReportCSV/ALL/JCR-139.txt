Query for name literal without namespace fails
Query for a name literal without a namespace fails. Example foo bla should return nodes with foo property that contain the String value bla or the Name value bla no namespace . Only nodes with String value bla are returned.- coerce string literal to name as soon as it appears as a valid name - changed coercing behaviour to only work on operations which are not ranges eq ne fixed in revision 191426
