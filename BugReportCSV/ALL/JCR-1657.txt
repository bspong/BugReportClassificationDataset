Cluster revision entries should be retrieved in order
The selectRevisionStmtSQL DatabaseJournal buildSqlStatements returns a result set which may not be ordered by REVISION ID. This has the effect that cluster instances that want to synchronize to the latest revision do not update their local revision appropriately since they assume that the revision result set is ordered see code in AbstractJournal doSync . This might cause a lot of unnecessary CPU cycles on these machines with degraded performance as a result. Furthermore it causes functional issues as well as events may be fired multiple times and in the wrong order.Attached a proposed patch.Looks good to me.Jukka thanks for having a look. Committed in revision 672125. Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 695958.
