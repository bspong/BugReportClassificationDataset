GData TestDateFormater sic fails when the Date returned is Sun 23 Sep 2007 01 29 06 GMT 00 00
TestDateFormater.testFormatDate fails when the Date returned is Sun 23 Sep 2007 01 29 06 GMT 00 00 The issue lies with the 00 00 at the end of the string. The question is though is that a valid date for GData This is marked as major b c it is causing nightly builds to fail. a cursory glance at the code in o.a.l.gdata.utils.DateFormater indicates that two SimpleDateFormater format strings are used ... they are both documented as Date format as it is used in Http Last modified header the only difference being between little z and big Z for timezones. while servers are generally suppose to be lenient in parsing formating of dates is always suppose to end in GMT so it seems that a maybe a setTimeZone cll on the formater when constructed is in order In reading http java.sun.com j2se 1.5.0 docs api java text SimpleDateFormat.html dates do not have to end in just GMT they can be GMT - and offset of hours and minutes. It seems like GMT 00 00 should be valid as the lowercase z symbol gives z Time zone General time zone Pacific Standard Time PST GMT-08 00 as an example. If I put in the Date above which caused a failure as a test on my machine it passes. I think the error is actually in the test in that the Pattern that is used to compare the output does not account for the GMT offset method for time zones. Thoughts If not I will put in a fix for the Regex to account for the GMT offset method. i won t dispute that the SImpleDateFormatter pattern is doing what it says it does ... my point is that according to the HTTP spec that s not the format that should be used ... the test is not buggy the code is. No matter what timezone or locale the test is executed in formated dates for the purpose of HTTP headers which is what this says it does should always end in GMT i believe the SimpelDateFormatter can be forced to do this if we use the setTimeZone method on the formatter by default it uses the system s current timezone OK here is a patch that sets the time zone I will give it a try on zones. I tried this out on zones and it passes and fails without it so I am going to apply it.
