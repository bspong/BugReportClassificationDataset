Bad transitive dependencies in commons-httpclient
As reported in HTTPCLIENT-605 the commons-httpclient 3.0 dependency introduces junit as a transitive compile scope dependency. The library also uses commons-logging which sidesteps Jackrabbit s use of slf4j for logging. To avoid these issues we should locally override the junit dependency in commons-httpclient and replace the commons-logging dependency with jcl104-over-slf4j.Fixed in revision 488412 merged to 1.2 in revision 488414.Commons httpclient 3.1 now uses scope test for junit 1 It still uses commons-logging however. 1 http repo1.maven.org maven2 commons-httpclient commons-httpclient 3.1 commons-httpclient-3.1.pom
