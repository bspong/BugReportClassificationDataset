Add SimpleFragListBuilder constructor with margin parameter
SimpleFragListBuilder would benefit from an additional constructor that takes in margin. Currently the margin is defined as a constant so to implement a FragListBuilder with a different margin one has no choice but to copy and paste SimpleFragListBuilder into a new class that must be placed in the org.apache.lucene.search.vectorhighlight package due to accesses of package-protected fields in other classes. If this change were made the precondition check of the constructor s fragCharSize should probably be altered to ensure that it s less than max 1 margin 3 to allow for a margin of 0. this makes sense though. I don t know to much about the highligher so I will wait a day or so if nobody steps up I will take this issue. Updated patch attached. I needed to update test. I ve also changed the visibility of the new member variable to package default for the test. I ll commit soon. committed in trunk and 3x. Thanks Kelsey Bulk close after release of 3.5
