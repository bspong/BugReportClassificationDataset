Occasional IndexingQueueTest failures
Every now and then when doing a clean build of the latest jackrabbit trunk I see the following test failure in jackrabbit-core Test set org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.TestAll Tests run 1 Failures 1 Errors 0 Skipped 0 Time elapsed 1.665 sec FAILURE testQueue org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.IndexingQueueTest Time elapsed 1.654 sec FAILURE junit.framework.AssertionFailedError         at junit.framework.Assert.fail Assert.java 47         at junit.framework.Assert.assertTrue Assert.java 20         at junit.framework.Assert.assertTrue Assert.java 27         at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.IndexingQueueTest.testQueue IndexingQueueTest.java 69 Typically the problem disappears when I rebuild but the test should still not have failed.Hmm that s because the nodes are dequeued before they are actually added to the index. I ve added additional synchronization to the test case which should fix the issue. Please re-open if you still see test failures. Fixed in revision 698946
