Allow o.a.j.jca.JCARepositoryManager to load repository configuration from the classpath.
The current implementation of o.a.j.jca.JCARepositoryManager is only able to load configuration files from the file system. It would be useful to allow the configuration to be loaded from the classpath also.This patch checks for the classpath prefix in the configPath. If present it attempts to load the class from the classpath and passes an InputStream to RepositoryConfig.create . If the prefix is not present the path is passed to RepositoryConfig.config as is. I chose the prefix because it is the same used in the Spring Framework. Its a public static final variable CLASSPATH CONFIG PREFIX so if that s not a good choice for Jackrabbit it can be easily changed. The patch also adds a bit of parameter documentation.thanks for the patch Mark
