Issue LUCENE-352 was closed but the patch there is not applied in the current trunk
See here http issues.apache.org jira browse LUCENE-352 And thanks for making JIRA easier I noticed the Lucene Java project was preselected for me. Regards Paul Elschot Resolved this by reopening the original issue. I m sorry about the extra jira update messages but this is more tidy in the end.
