Workspace.xml can t be loaded if it has a BOM
I wondered if there was a specific reason why workspace.xml files are loaded using a FileReader instead of an InputStream in RepositoryConfig If the workspace.xml file has a BOM which could happen if someone edited the file manually with some misbehaving editor then it can t be loaded Content not allowed in prolog - here s a little patch that fixes this. I left the output part untouched i.e still using a Writer - which makes it a little inconsistent - maybe someone with a better knowledge of the JR FileSystem api could fix this. Why would that be a misbehaving editor Because it makes Jackrabbit unhappy More seriously simply because it modified the file - most likely - without informing the user. If some software modifies the format of a file it edits into what is essentially a different format one could qualify that as misbehavior. That s sort out of the scope of this issue though Yep. I just wanted to clarify that a UTF-8 BOM is totally legal in an XML file. It is and unfortunately as it stands Jackrabbit won t support it.Good catch thanks Patch applied in revision 709142.Merged to the 1.4 branch in revision 736684.
