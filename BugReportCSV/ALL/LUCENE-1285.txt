WeightedSpanTermExtractor incorrectly treats the same terms occurring in different query types
Given a BooleanQuery with multiple clauses if a term occurs both in a Span Phrase query and in a TermQuery the results of term extraction are unpredictable and depend on the order of clauses. Concequently the result of highlighting are incorrect. Example text t1 t2 t3 t4 t2 Example query t2 t3 t1 t2 Current highlighting t1 t2 t3 t4 t2 Correct highlighting t1 t2 t3 t4 t2 The problem comes from the fact that we keep a Map termText WeightedSpanTerm and if the same term occurs in a Phrase or Span query the resulting WeightedSpanTerm will have a positionSensitive true whereas terms added from TermQuery have positionSensitive false. The end result for this particular term will depend on the order in which the clauses are processed. My fix is to use a subclass of Map which on put always sets the result to the most lax setting i.e. if we already have a term with positionSensitive true and we try to put a term with positionSensitive false we set the result positionSensitive false as it will match both cases. A patch to fix the issue. Nice catch and the fix looks great. Thanks Andrzej. Test that exposes the problem. The posted patch makes the test pass. Mark Mark are you done with this would you like to commit this Or should I Asking because of SOLR-553 Just had a go at committing this. Looks good to me. It looks like Mark already committed this but forgot resolve this issue so I m marking it as Fixed.
