Add DataInput DataOutput subclasses that delegate to an InputStream OutputStream.
Such classes would be handy for FST serialization deserialization. A patch moving these stream delegation classes to org.apache.lucene.store. A potential bugfix is piggybacked potential partial read byte was not handled correctly . Patch looks good. Two comments The files are missing the Apache License header. In some places you use this.is this.out and others just is out. Can you consolidate on one I prefer w o this. I agree with moving these to .store package sorry I forgot about this in the suggest refactoring. I ve had to write similar classes myself before since they were not there. Thanks Shai. I ll add the headers clean up this where applicable and commit in. Updated patch applied. bulk close for 3.3
