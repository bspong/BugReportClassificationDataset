Cut over numeric docvalues to fixed straight bytes
Currently numeric docvalues types are encoded and stored individually which creates massive duplication of writing indexing code. Yet almost all of them except packed ints are essentially a fixed straight bytes variant. here is a patch that factors out multiple base classes shared across variant specific docvalues writers readers. Numerics subclasses FixedStraightBytesImpl.Writer and reuses and only encodes incoming values as a fixed sized bytes. Other byte variants share common base classes and override necessary parts for their specific variant. This removes a large amount of code from docvalues which I should have done earlier. However this is a first step towards fixing the merge problem since we can now almost exclusively operate on bytes rather than ints floats doubles etc. on the implementation level. I plan to commit this tomorrow if nobody objects. Its basically an internal refactoring except of the additions to BytesRef committed in rev 1176906.
