contrib bdb-persistence update berkeleydb version
berkeleydb dependency should be updated to 2.0.83 already available at ibiblio. At this moment project.xml lists 1.7.1 which is very old. There are no code changes required and the PM works correctly with berkeleydb 2.0.83 dependency groupId berkeleydb groupId artifactId je artifactId version 2.0.83 version type jar type dependency I ve been using 2.0.90 for a few months already without any problems. . alex .w the mindstorm p. Upgraded the dependency to 2.0.83 in revision 395364. Thanks for suggesting this.
