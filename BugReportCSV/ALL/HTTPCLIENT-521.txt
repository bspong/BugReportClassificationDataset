SimpleHttpConnectionManager is used incorrectly by tutorial code
Using pretty well standard from the tutorial code causes the SimpleHttpConnectionManager to print its being used incorrectly warning if the connection times out or other I O exception occurs . I will attach a simple test I made to demonstrate this.Created an attachment id 16818 Connection released twice Created an attachment id 16821 Patch The warning in releaseConnection method is indeed too agressive. This should take care of the problem OlegThanks that will fix it. Also thanks for the speed of the reply. It still worries me that the HttpMethodDirector is releasing the connection in the first place. I realize that it does not matter in this particular case but all the docs seem to indicate that the connection will not be released unless you explicitly release it. In reply to comment 3 ... It still worries me that the HttpMethodDirector is releasing the connection in the first place. I realize that it does not matter in this particular case but all the docs seem to indicate that the connection will not be released unless you explicitly release it. It should be absolutely safe to call releaseConnection multiple times. If anything in documentation can be interpreted as suggesting otherwise it need to be corrected. If I hear no objections I ll commit the patch tomorrow 22 00 GMT OlegPatch checked in Oleg HTTPCLIENT-528 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug.
