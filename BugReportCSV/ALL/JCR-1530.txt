MsPowerPointTextExtractor does not extract from PPTs with Û sign
The MsPowerPointTextExtractor class has a problem when reading PPTs when an Û sign is contained. All text following that sign is ignored. Perhaps the POI PowerPointExtractor should be used instead of parsing the data by hand. As a side effect this would simply the code. Extracting could be done as follows public Reader extractText InputStream stream String type String encoding throws IOException try PowerPointExtractor extractor new PowerPointExtractor stream return new StringReader extractor.getText true true catch RuntimeException e logger.warn Failed to extract PowerPoint text content e return new StringReader finally try stream.close catch IOException ignored Hmm IMHO it shouldn t be Jackrabbit s concern to handle such details especially as text extraction from binary files is not a mandatory aspect of the JCR API. What about using Apache Tika It aims to collect all the various extraction libraries and self-built classes of the Apache project and to build a proper re-usable framework. It recently pushed out its first release. Jukka you probably know more about it - is it already useful for Jackrabbit You mentioned in JCR-1290 that this could be a task for Jackrabbit 1.5. http incubator.apache.org tika There are at least two minor issues with using Tika in Jackrabbit. - Tika is still in incubation. I d prefer to only introduce a dependency to it when it is out of incubation. - Tika requires Java 1.5 whereas Jackrabbit currently is fine with 1.4. We might want to provide an adapter which implements the Jackrabbit TextExtractor interface and uses Tika to extract the text. Users then can decide if they want to use it and therefore need to use Java 1.5.Applied patch in revision 647114 Thank you for providing the patch.
