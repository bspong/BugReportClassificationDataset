Extend mimetype list of text extractors
Do you think it would be possible to extend the mimetype list of the MsPowerpoint and MsExcel textextractors with application powerpoint and application excel It just took me half an hour to figure out why my documents didn t turn up in a jackrabbit fulltext-search and maybe other users might run into the same problem... I m not sure if there is some kind of standard which lists the possible default mimetypes but after a quick google search it seems to me that they are not that uncommon. Patch to add the missing mimetypesPatch applied with some line wraps in revision 671515. Thanks PS. The official list of media types is available at http www.iana.org assignments media-types index.html and lists application vnd.ms-excel and application vnd.ms-powerpoint as the proper media types for Excel and PowerPoint documents. However having commonly used aliases recognized by the text extractors can only help.
