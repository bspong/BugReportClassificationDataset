Remove dependency on EDU.oswego.cs.dl.util.concurrent
EDU.oswego.cs.dl.util.concurrent is in maintenance mode and http g.oswego.edu dl classes EDU oswego cs dl util concurrent package-summary.html advises to migrate to the JDK5 java.util.concurrent package. patch using Semaphore instead of Mutex Sync test still pass but somebody should review this Works for me. One thing I noted however The methods dispose and onEventReceived should probably not release the semaphore when an InterruptedException has been thrown. That was not a problem with Mutex since there release was idempotent. I think this is different with Semaphore. Patch removing the remaining dependencies to EDU.oswego.cs.dl.util.concurrent. Please review.PS JCR-2324.patch includes Julian s initial patch and also handles InterruptedException as I suggested in an earlier comment.hmm that doesn t work for me. I get lots of node type related errors when running tests in jackrabbit-spi2jcr. might be related to the replacement of ConcurrentReaderHashMap with ConcurrentHashMap which is not exactly the same. It seems some tests now pick a different node type than before because the iteration order is different with the patch applied.Are you on the latest trunk In particular make sure you have the fixes from JCR-2337 and JCR-2338.Fails here as well and actually in the same way these failed when I tried the same approach - I fixed JCR-2346 which caused problems with JDK 1.6. Now it works for me both with 1.5 and 1.6 on Windows XP. Could you try again on your side Works for me. Thanks for figuring out what was wrong essentially a bug in the test suite .Fixed in revision 822311
