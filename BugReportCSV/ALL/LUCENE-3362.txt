Initialization error of Junit tests with solr-test-framework with IDEs and Maven
I m currently developping a new component for Solr. And in my Netbeans project I have created two Test classes for this component one class for simple unit tests derived from SolrTestCaseJ4 class and a second one for tests with sharding derived from BaseDistributedSearchTestCase . When I launch a test with these two classes I have an error in the initialization of the second class of tests no matter the class is this is always the second executed class which fails . The error comes from an assert which failed in the begining of the function initRandom of LuceneTestCase class assert random.initialized But if I launch each test class separatly all the tests succeed After a discussion with Mr. Muir the problems seems to be related to the incompatibility of the class LuceneTestCase with the functioning of Maven projects in IDEs. According to mister Muir The problem is that via ant tests work like this e.g. for 3 test classes computeTestMethods beforeClass afterClass computeTestMethods beforeClass AfterClass computeTestMethods beforeClass afterClass but via an IDE if you run it from a folder like you did then it does this computeTestMethods computeTestMethods computeTestMethods beforeClass afterClass beforeClass afterClass beforeClass afterClass Wait this can t affect 3.3.0. I didnt add this assert until a couple weeks ago https issues.apache.org jira secure attachment 12487642 SOLR-2673 randomize methods.patch the only good solution given the different workflows these different testrunners do is for the runner to have its own seed. the problem is that any other solution either gives us non-reproducibility of tests or we must give up the shuffling of test methods... I don t want to do either. patch changes them to hex so the seed values are about as long as they are now nobody cares whats in them and its all copy-paste anyway . Thanks for reporting this GŽrald
