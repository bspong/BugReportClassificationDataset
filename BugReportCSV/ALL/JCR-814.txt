Oracle bundle PM fails checking schema if 2 users use the same database
When using the OracleBundlePersistenceManager there is an issue when two users use the same database for persistence. In that case the checkSchema method of the BundleDbPersistenceManager does not work like it should. More precisely the call metaData.getTables null null tableName null will also includes table names of other schemas users. Effectively only the first user of a database is able to create the schema. probably same issue as here JCR-582fixed.This breaks the MS-SQL bundle persistence manager since it does not detect an existing schema. The fix is to override the checkSchema in the OracleBundlePersistenceManager with the fix of Tobias for the metaData.getTables call. I guess that the issue should be reopenend but I am not allowed to do that. Regards Martijn Hendriks due to issue mentioned above.Separated the table-existence-check from the schema creation and only override it in oracle persistence manager. Committed revision 523680.
