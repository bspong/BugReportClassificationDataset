AbstractHttpClient.determineTarget does not recognize target host correctly
I am trying to execute an HttpGet with the following URI http www.foo.foo doSomething.html url http www.bar.bar doSomethingElse.html This leads to UnknownHostException Going through the internal code the problem seems to be in the AbstractHttpClient.determineTarget method             String ssp requestURI.getSchemeSpecificPart             ssp ssp.substring 2 ssp.length remove prefix             int end ssp.indexOf 0 ssp.indexOf                     ssp.indexOf 0 ssp.indexOf                     ssp.indexOf 0 ssp.indexOf ssp.length             String host ssp.substring 0 end This code sets the target host to www.foo.foo doSomething.html url http instead of www.foo.foo . This obviously breaks the execution not far down the line... DefaultClientConnectionOperator.resolveHostname throws an UnknownHostException. FWIW the AbstractHttpClient.determineTarget method actually has access to the request URI object which correctly states that the host is www.foo.foo . So why does it try to extract the host from the scheme specific part anyway I hope this is useful... and if there is any workaround please let me know as I m stuck on this one. MarcoDuplicate of HTTPCLIENT-1038. Fixed in SVN trunk. OlegI was thinking... if the determineTarget method really has to do this host extraction itself... shouldn t it use      requestURI.getRawSchemeSpecificPart instead of      requestURI.getSchemeSpecificPart At least that should solve this type of problem right Workarounds seem difficult. The called method is private in AbstractHttpClient... and the calling method is public final. MarcoThanks Oleg. I m sorry I opened a duplicate issue. I searched through the open ones but I didn t think of going through the solved issues. I ll get the SVN trunk version then. Marco
