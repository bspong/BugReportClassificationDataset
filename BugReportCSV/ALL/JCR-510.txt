TCK AddNodeTest requires implementation to support one-parameter addNode method on test node
This test requires a repository to support addNode String one argument on the test node. However JSR-170 does not require an implementation to have at least one child node definition with a default primary type. For such repositories this test will fail regardless of configuration. Proposal introduce a configuration property which if set causes calls to addNode String to be replaced with addNode String String .Node.addNode String is actually not required for those test cases. Therefore I removed the relevant calls from the tests. Fixed in revision 428010 Thank you for reporting this issue.
