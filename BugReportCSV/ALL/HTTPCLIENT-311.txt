getScheme and getPort return wrong defaults for HttpsURL
getScheme if called on an instance of HttpsURL wrongly returns http instead of https. That s because dynamic data binding doesn t work for final static fields see DEFAULT SCHEME .Same applies to the default port as well. Can be solved by either making the constants non-static or better overwrite the two methods in the subclass.Created an attachment id 10106 Copied methods from the superclass to fix getPort and getScheme I agree that overwriting the methods is the better solution. These can simply be copied from HttpURL. I have attached the trivial patch that does right that.Created an attachment id 10107 take 2 Added a test case that exhibits the problem. Referencing the constants in a static way to make it clearer. Will commit to 2.0 branch in 24h if nobody complains and then port it to CVS HEAD.As there were no objections I have committed the patch to both branch and head.
