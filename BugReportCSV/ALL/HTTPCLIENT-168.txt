Include generated website in the distribution
A user should be able to build the non-api docs as well. So it would be nice to include xdocs in the source packages as well ...I don t think its desirable to include the xdocs directory. If a user is sophisticated to generate a custom site with maven then they are sophisticated enough to checkout the source tree with CVS. However a complete generated site would be useful to include in the distribution.Well AFAIK velocity the jakarta-site2 stylesheet are sufficient to build the docs i.e. maven is not really required . The reason for this is to be able to build an off-line or better local version of the docs where one is able to adapt all links to external sources to its local dev doc site. Getting the stuff from CVS is not really a good solution since one can«t build the stuff in off-line mode and further the docs might not correspond to the downloaded source package ... Please have a look at the velocity build build.xml file It s really simple to add an anakia task which is able to build docs even in the off-line mode ... Mike that would be great if it does not look too much if though I was pushing you to do work I was unable or unwilling to do myself. OlegNo worries. I m happy to look into it. Adrian if you have any thoughts suggestions on the matter I would be more than happy to hear them MikeCreated an attachment id 8240 Patch 1 I believe the attached patch will do the trick. To create a distribution that includes the site run either maven site generate dist ÊÊor maven httpclient dist Please give this a shot and let me know. I will also look into updating the release documentation. MikeHas anyone tried this Should I go ahead and commit MikeMike the patch looks good. Go ahead and commit it OlegPatch applied.
