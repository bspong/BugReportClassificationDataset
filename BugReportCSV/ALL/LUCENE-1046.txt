Dead code in SpellChecker.java branch never executes 
SpellChecker contains the following lines of code final int goalFreq morePopular ir null ir.docFreq new Term field word 0 if the word exists in the real index and we don t care for word frequency return the word itself if morePopular goalFreq 0 return new String word The branch will never execute the only way for goalFreq to be greater than zero is if morePopular is true but if morePopular is true the expression in the if statement evaluates to false. Thanks for your report could you try out this patch Good catch. I ll commit next week. Danke schšn. Committed revision 659019. Note this patch has the effect of changing output from the spell checker. I think the new behavior is correct just letting people know that they will now get the original word back for this case where they did not before.
