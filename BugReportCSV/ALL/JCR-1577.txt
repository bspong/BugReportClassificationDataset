Remove RepositoryService.getRootId 
For consistency reasons jcr2spi should use idFactory.createNodeId String null pathFactory.getRootPath everywhere to build the NodeId of the root node. having two separate methods is confusing.Patch which deprecates RepositoryService.getRootId fine with me. does anybody object btw... since we already remove other methods from the RepositoryService i guess i would rather remove this as well. ... i would rather remove this ... 1
