highlight-vs-vector-highlight.alg is unfair
highlight-vs-vector-highlight.alg uses EnwikiQueryMaker which makes SpanQueries but FastVectorHighlighter simply ignores SpanQueries. The patch introduces a boolean property enwikiQueryMaker.disableSpanQueries. If it is set to true default is false EnwikiQueryMaker doesn t make SpanQueries. results elapsedSec are Ê FastVectorHL HL w o patch 7.70 20.25 w patch 7.67 19.07 Because FastVectorHighlighter s strength is the performance when processing large docs this patch includes set max.field.length Integer.MAX VALUE in the alg file introduces a new property highlighter.maxDocCharsToAnalyze and set it Integer.MAX VALUE in the alg file Patch looks good thanks Koji. I ll commit shortly Thanks Koji
