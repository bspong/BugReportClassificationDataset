openReaderPassed not populated in CheckIndex.Status.SegmentInfoStatus
When using CheckIndex programatically the openReaderPassed flag on the SegmentInfoStatus is never populated so it always comes back false looking at the code its clear that openReaderPassed is defined but never used furthermore it appears that not all information that is propagated to the InfoStream is available via SegmentIinfoStatus All of the following information should be able to be gather from public properties on the SegmentInfoStatus test open reader.........OK test fields norms.......OK 2 fields test terms freq prox...OK 101 terms 133 terms docs pairs 133 tokens test stored fields.......OK 100 total field count avg 1 fields per doc test term vectors........OK 0 total vector count avg 0 term freq vector fields per doc OK I committed a fix for openReaderPassed. Thanks Tim Could you or anyone but since you seem to have the itch... create a patch for the further details you d like returned I will work up a patch if i am able to find the time currently as a workaround i am just setting the infostream to System.stderr when a verbose output is needed which is acceptable for my current use Attached patch for exposing all collected stats created with svn diff CheckIndex.patch please correct me if this is not the right way this is my first patch This patch breaks out the testing of field norms terms stored fields and term vectors into their own methods it also creates a status object for each one of these tests to make the results transparent this status object exposes stats previously only available from infoStream exception thrown if test fails null if test was successful each SegmentInfoStatus will have these status objects attached NOTE This patch allows that if one of the above tests fails it will attempt to keep testing to find all failures any failure will still result in the overall segment being rejected This patch is awesome Tim thanks I will commit in a day or two. Thanks Tim
