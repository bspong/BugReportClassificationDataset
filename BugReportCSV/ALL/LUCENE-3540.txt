In 3.x branch starting with 3.4 the IndexFormatTooOldException was backported but the error message was not modified for 3.x This version of Lucene only supports indexes created with release 3.0 and later. In 3.x it must be This version of Lucene only supports indexes created with release 1.9 and later. Indexes before 1.9 will throw this exception on reading SegmentInfos LUCENE-3255 . I verified The file shipped with TestBackwardsCompatibility has a single segments file with -1 as first int. An old pre-1.9 index has a positive number and this was excluded in LUCENE-3255. Updated patch that also makes use of IndexFormatTooNewException in 3.x it was unused before but as its there it should also be used . Committed 3.x branch revision 1190293 Thanks Uwe Bulk close after release of 3.5
