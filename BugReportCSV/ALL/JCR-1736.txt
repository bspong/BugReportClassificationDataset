Expose BootstrapConfig in Servlets
the RepostitoryStartup and RepositroyAccess servlets use a bootstrap config object for initialization. in order to generate diagnostics reports it would be very useful to be able to access them.fixed as proposed.Can this wait for 1.5 or do you need it already in 1.4.6 If possible I d rather only include bug fixes in the maintenance branch.my servlets that extends the jackrabbit ones need to do a java-security hack to access the private config fields. it would be nice if this can be avoided. it would be very convenient for me having them in 1.4.6If we do included this in 1.4 that would be in a jackrabbit-webapp 1.4.1 release instead of jackrabbit-core 1.4.6.Reopening this issue. I see that the change was only applied to the 1.4 branch and since I don t see us releasing that code anymore we should keep this open until the change has been merged to the trunk.I applied the patch to trunk in revision 793559 and to the 1.x branch in revision 793561.
