Redirection of a POST method
I execute a PostMethod to an URL which redirects me to a HTML page. If I set follow redirects to true the HttpClient wants to execute once more a POST. Of course a POST is not allowed to HTML pages. I think the HttpClient should exectue a GET method instead. That s also what is in the RFC2616 10.3 Redirection 3xx    This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be    taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request. The action    required MAY be carried out by the user agent without interaction    with the user if and only if the method used in the second request is    GET or HEAD. A client SHOULD detect infinite redirection loops since    such loops generate network traffic for each redirection.       Note previous versions of this specification recommended a       maximum of five redirections. Content developers should be aware       that there might be clients that implement such a fixed       limitation.I strongly disagree it s HttpClient s responsibility to check what type of URL a request is redirected to. I do not think the HttpClient should take liberty in changing a request type matter how appropriate that might seem at the first glance. This kind of decision should better be taken on a higher level that is by the HttpClient consumerI agree with you that the HttpClient should not check what kind of URL the redirect is. But please take once more a look to the RFC 10.3 Redirection 3xx . The second request forwarded method can only be a GET or HEAD. POST is not allowed.Entity enclosing methods now disallow automatic redirection
