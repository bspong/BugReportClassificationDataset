Merging multiple indexes does not maintain document order.
When I merge multiple indexes into a single empty index the document addition order is not being maintained. Self contained test case coming as soon as I figure out how to attach it The attached JUnit test case should demonstrate the problem. See the comments inside of the test case. I refactored the previous test to demonstrate the problem both with FSDirectory and with RAMDirectory. interestingly they fail at differnet document numbers. file should live in package org.apache.lucene.index Fix committed to the latest dev version soon to be Lucene 2.0 Fix verified here. Thanks for the rapid repair.
