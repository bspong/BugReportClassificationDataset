NameSet does not implement equals Object and hashCode methods
The merge context uses the NameSet.equals NameSet method to compare two sets however the NameSet class does not override the default Object.equals Object method and does not inherit from AbstractSet E . Therefore the merge check fails even though the mixin sets are the same. Object instance equivalence is being performed as opposed to set equivalence. Behavior is observed when more than one thread is checking the ISM at a given time. Demonstration code available upon request. From NodeStateMerger line 83                  mixin types                 if state.getMixinTypeNames .equals overlayedState.getMixinTypeNames                      the mixins have been modified but by just looking at the diff we                      can t determine where the change happened since the diffs of either                      removing a mixin from the overlayed or adding a mixin to the                      transient state would look identical...                     return false                  Proposed solution - Implement NameSet.equals ... method public boolean equals Object obj if obj null obj instanceof NameSet NameSet oo NameSet obj return oo.names.equals this.names return false Fixed as proposed and added test case in revision 768218Can this fix be applied to the 1.5 branch as well We re running into merge failures as a result of this issue so backporting would be very appreciated - thanks FrankSure merged to the 1.5 branch in revision 776771.
