Add isDeclaredMember method to Group
I suggest to add a method for checking whether an authorizable is a declared member of a group. Currently there is only a method for checking membership which includes indirect memberships .            Test whether an link Authorizable is a declared member of this group.       param authorizable The code Authorizable code to test.       return code true code if the Authorizable to test is a direct member       throws RepositoryException If an error occurs.           boolean isDeclaredMember Authorizable authorizable throws RepositoryException Fixed at revision 1031115
