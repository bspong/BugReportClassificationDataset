Collapse Common module into Lucene core util
It was suggested by Robert in http markmail.org message wbfuzfamtn2qdvii that we should try to limit the dependency graph between modules and where there is something common it should probably go into lucene core. Given that I haven t added anything to this module except the MutableValue classes I m going to collapse them into the util package remove the module and correct the dependencies. Patch which updates classes and dependencies. Everything compiles and passes. Command for patch svn mkdir lucene src java org apache lucene util mutable svn move modules common src java org apache lucene common mutable MutableValue .java lucene src java org apache lucene util mutable svn delete modules common svn delete dev-tools maven modules common svn delete dev-tools idea modules common I m going to commit this tomorrow. Committed revision 1143234.
