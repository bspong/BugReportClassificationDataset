Inconsistent state when removing mix lockable from a locked Node
when the lock holder removes mix lockable from a locked node the lock related properties get removed. however the lock still is live and present on the node. i would have expected that either - removing mix lockable was not allowed or - the lock was automatically released test code     public void testRemoveMixLockableFromLockedNode throws RepositoryException         Node n testRootNode.addNode nodeName1         n.addMixin mixLockable         testRootNode.save         Lock l n.lock true true         n.removeMixin mixLockable         n.save         assertFalse n.isNodeType mixLockable ok         assertFalse l.isLive lock is still live         assertFalse n.isLocked node is still locked         List tokens Arrays.asList superuser.getLockTokens         assertFalse tokens.contains l.getLockToken session contains the token         assertFalse n.hasProperty jcrLockOwner ok. prop got removed.         assertFalse n.hasProperty jcrlockIsDeep ok. prop got removed.         n.unlock LockException node not lockable      suggested fix add an extra check for the Node being lock if Node.removeMixin is called with mix lockable similar to the corresponding check for existing references if an attempt is made to remove mix referenceable .
