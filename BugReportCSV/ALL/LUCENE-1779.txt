Remove unused numSlotsFull from FieldComparator.setNextReader
This param is a relic from older optimizations that we ve since turned off and it s quite confusing. I don t think we need it and we haven t released the API yet so we re free to remove it now. Attached patch Spruces up javadocs for FieldComparator Removes int numSlotsFull from FieldComparator.setNextReader Removes redundant reverse arg to SortField.getComparator Marks SortField.getComparator as subject to suddenly change I think it s ready to commit... I ll wait a day or so. 1 Thanks Mike much improved FieldComparator.sortType is an interesting one too... I don t think it s currently used and I have a hard time seeing how it could be used when custom sort fields are involved . FieldComparator.sortType is an interesting one too Agreed I ll remove it It sure is fun removing things New patch removing FieldComparator.sortType .
