Improve docs for deployment Models 1 and 2 on Tomcat 5.5.x and provide an example webapp.
New users would find a small webapp and associated documentation that walks them through the process of setting up a model 1 or model 2 or both deployment scheme.A suggested sample webapp and documentation along with a maven project to build the docs and webapp.I just configured another system to use jackrabbit for the first time and left out the JAAS configuration. I installed the webapp and it ran without any problems... no security exceptions or anything else. I m thinking of taking the JAAS section out of the docs for the test app since they don t seem to be needed I think simplicity is key for getting people up and running with a repository to play with. At the same time the JSR 170 spec says very little about how security works inside a JCR repository and Jackrabbit s documentation on the subject is also rather sparse. I m not sure if the webapp should be working without the jaas.config file and associated JAVA OPTS environment in place.Fixed a bug in the code and removed my original package hierarchy it was empty anyway . The documentation hasn t changed.Merged the contributed sources and documentation with minor modifications e.g. removed the few Java 5 specific lines into contrib examples in revision 387045. The documentation should still be migrated into the main Jackrabbit web site. Resolving this issue as fixed though as the contribution is now in the Jackrabbit tree and further improvements can be sent as patches attached to new issues. Thanks again Mark
