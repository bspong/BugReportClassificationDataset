Snowball package contains BSD licensed code with ASL header
All classes in org.tartarus.snowball but not in org.tartarus.snowball.ext has for some reason been given an ASL header. These classes are licensed with BSD. Thus the ASL header should be removed. I suppose this a misstake or possible due to the ASL header automation tool. I suppose this a misstake or possible due to the ASL header automation tool. Yes. If BSD is an approved license it would be nice if RAT would recognize it and then we could just add it to these files. But RAT doesn t appear to. It just looks for http dojotoolkit.org community licensing.shtml and TMF854 Version 1.0 - Copyright TeleManagement Forum - which it considers modified BSD. Weak. Anyway NOTICE should also state the license for Snowball along with the copyright as well. reads weird - i know the copyright is there with a link - but it should state the license as well We should actually add a comment in the files about the BSD license as well - to keep this from being a recurring theme. Added Snowball license header to static Snowball classes SnowballProgram Among and TestApp Refactored StringBuffer to StringBuilder in all classes Added notes about above in README and package overview. Committed in revision 823445
