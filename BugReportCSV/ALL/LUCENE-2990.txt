Improve ArrayUtil CollectionUtil. Sort methods to early-reaturn on empty or one-element lists arrays
It might be a good idea to make CollectionUtil or ArrayUtil return early if the passed-in list or array s length 1 because sorting is unneeded then. This improves maybe automaton or other places as for empty or one-element lists no SorterTermplate is created. Simplier patch no duplicate checks missed to see delegation . Add corresponding tests Uwe patch looks good. I wonder if we could change the variable name from l to length or maybe size. I had to look twice here if l 1 return to realize that you don t compare one one Will do. Courier New is an ugly font Renamed local variable from l to size .
