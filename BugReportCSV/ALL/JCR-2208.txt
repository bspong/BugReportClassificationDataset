update tests so that both Query.XPATH and Query SQL are treated as optional features
In JCR 2.0 both Query.XPATH and Query.SQL are optional or actually deprecated . We either need to modify the tests so that they pass on a repository that doesn t support them - NotExecutableException or remove them altogether.there are likely cases where missing support for XPath will cause test failures but right now I have no way to test this as Jackrabbit seems to rely on XPath support being present internally.checked tests by temporarily remvoing Query.XPATH from Jackrabbit s getSupportedQueryLanguages method return value. Updated test class so that it always checks for support that way see revision 805447
