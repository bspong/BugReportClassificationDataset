SPI Get rid of unused method ItemInfo.getParentId 
Looking at the various SPI impls in the trunk and in the sandbox reveals that ItemInfo.getParentId is not used at all. I d like to suggest to get rid of that method. Any objections concerns angela assuming lazy consensus. i will remove the method with the SPI and the impls in spi2jcr spi-commons and the sandbox.jackrabbit-spi rev. 649404 - removed method from ItemInfo interface jackrabbit-spi-commons rev. 649404 - deprecated old constructors - added new constructors without parentId - removed method jackrabbit-spi2jcr rev. 649404 - adjusted accordingly sandbox rev. 649406 - adjusted ItemInfo implementations in spi2dav - spi-rmi and spi-logge nothing to do
