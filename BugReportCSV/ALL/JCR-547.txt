SimpleSelectionTest assumes RowIterator.getSize not to return -1
Test case testSingleProperty assumes that RowIterator.getSize will not return -1. This is an incorrect assumption according to the JavaDoc for RangeIterator. Suggested change         long size result.getRows .getSize         if size -1             assertEquals Should have only 1 result 1 size          I ve fixed it the following way - assertEquals Should have only 1 result 1 result.getRows .getSize assertEquals Should have only 1 result 1 getSize result.getRows Which has the same effect as your suggestion. svn revision 433644 Thank you for reporting this issue.
