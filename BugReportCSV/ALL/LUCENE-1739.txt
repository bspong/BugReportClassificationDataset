2.4.x index cannot be opened with 2.9-dev
Sorry for the lack of proper testcase. In 2.4.1 if you created an index with the stupid options below then it will not create a .prx file. 2.9 expects this file and will not open the index. The reason i used these stupid options is because i changed the field from indexed yes to indexed no but forgot to remove the .setOmitTf public class Testcase public static void main String args throws Exception run this part with lucene 2.4.1 IndexWriter iw new IndexWriter test new WhitespaceAnalyzer IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength.LIMITED iw.setUseCompoundFile false Document doc new Document Field field1 new Field field1 foo Field.Store.YES Field.Index.NO field1.setOmitTf true 2.9 will create a 0-byte .prx file but 2.4.x will NOT. This is the problem. 2.9 expects this file doc.add field1 iw.addDocument doc iw.close run this with lucene 2.9 IndexReader ir IndexReader.open FSDirectory.getDirectory test true Good catch Robert I ll fold this into the back compat test. OK indeed at some point in 2.9 FieldInfo.omitTFAP became hardwired to false if the field isn t indexed whereas 2.4 simply preserved whatever the developer had set. I have a simple fix which is to have FieldInfos.hasProx disregard the omitTFAP member when the field is not indexed. And I added a test case to the back-compat test showing the problem the fix. I ll commit shortly. Thanks Robert Keep testing
