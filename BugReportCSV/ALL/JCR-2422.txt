Add the new DataSource element to the repository DTD
The connection pooling feature from JCR-1456 introduced a new DataSource configuration element to Jackrabbit. It should be added to the repository config DTD.Here s a patch that adds the DataSources element to the DTD. It also changes the configuration a bit instead of specifiying the logical name of a data source as a parameter element it is now an attribute. This looks nicer I think.Somehow overlooked that Jukka was assignee....assigning it back.Feel free to take over especially since you already wrote a patch for this. I originally planned to do this already on Friday thus assigned it to myself but was occupied with other things and didn t yet have a chance to work on this.Ok applied the patch in revision 888298.
