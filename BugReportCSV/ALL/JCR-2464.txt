Reduce usage of String.intern 
String.intern is used for interning the namespace URI in NameImpl. For some trivial cases the intern method shouldn t be called but a constant should be used. E.g. I m thinking about the empty namespace URI where calling String.intern is way more expensive than checking if the length of the URI string is zero.Proposed patch.Applied patch to trunk in revision 898677 and merged into 2.0 branch in revision 898680
