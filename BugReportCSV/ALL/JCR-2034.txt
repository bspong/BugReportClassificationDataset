Add an option so skip the checkSchema methods
Sometimes the checkSchema methods in the various components DB filesystem DB persistence manager DB journal fail to detect that the required tables already exist with as result that the startup fails. See the mail thread on the dev list http jackrabbit.markmail.org message jtq2sqis2aceh7ro . An option to just skip the checkSchema methods on startup would solve this issue.Here s a possible solution that disables the schema checks if you specify the java option org.apache.jackrabbit.core.util.db.schemacheck with value false. By default the schema check is enabled.Could this be a normal Jackrabbit configuration option instead of a system property Yes on second thought I think that a normal configuration option is better. I ll create a new patch....and here it is.Committed revision 796957.Merged to the 1.x branch in revision 801133.
