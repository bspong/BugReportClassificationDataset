Unnecessary null check in EffectiveNodeType.getApplicableChildNodeDef 
This is just a trivial thing I noticed this while inspecting the code. getApplicableChildNodeDef says          try named node definitions first         ItemDef defs getNamedItemDefs name         if defs null but getNamedItemDefs is currently defined to not return null     public ItemDef getNamedItemDefs Name name         List defs List namedItemDefs.get name         if defs null defs.size 0             return ItemDef.EMPTY ARRAY                  return ItemDef defs.toArray new ItemDef defs.size      I didn t check to see if there were any other unnecessary null checks.Fixed as suggested in revision 691324. Thanks
