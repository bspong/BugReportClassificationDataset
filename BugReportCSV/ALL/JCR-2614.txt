Include the WebDAV litmus tests in the Jackrabbit integration tests
It would be great to integrate the litmus tests http www.webdav.org neon litmus to our integration test suite.The Litmus test suite is now a part of the integrationTesting profile. Apart from two known issues JCR-2637 and JCR-2638 the tests run fine. Resolving as fixed.
