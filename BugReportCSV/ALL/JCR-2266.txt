Skip deployment of jackrabbit-standalone
The jackrabbit-standalone jar currently can t be deployed to the repository.apache.org server probably because of its size. I m not sure if there are any good use cases where you d want to use the standalone jar as a Maven dependency so having it on Maven central doesn t seem that important. I d like to make this explicit by configuring the deploy plugin to skip deploying the standalone jar.Done in revision 813031.Hello all I would like to use jackrabbit-standalone from Maven for testing our upcoming Apache Commons VFS 2.1. If you have a better idea on how to do the following please advise. I want to run our VFS WebDAV unit tests using Jackrabbit as a server embedded in the test. In previous versions a developer had to set up a WebDAV server manually and run the one test. What I started to do is use jackrabbit-standalone 1.6.5 but it does not have the JcrUtils class which came in with Jackrabbit 2.0. My current code Create a temp dir Create a TransientRepository point to the temp dir Use JcrUtils to import a directory its subdirectories full of test files I cannot do this ATM. Shutdown the TransientRepository Start Jackrabbit with org.apache.jackrabbit.standalone.Main noformat org.apache.jackrabbit.standalone.Main.main new String port Integer.toString SocketPort repo repoDirectory.toString noformat The tests run I would like to use the latest jackrabbit but I am stuck without the standalone jar.
