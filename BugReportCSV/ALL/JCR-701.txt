Upgrade to Xerces 2.8.1
Besides a number of bug fixes and new features in Xerces upgrading to a newer version would also give us better dependency metadata and thus avoid the need of having a separate xmlParserAPIs dependency in addition to the main xercesImpl dependency.Upgraded to Xerces 2.8.1 in revision 493239.Hm. I m not really sure why we have a dependency on Xerces at all. The JDKs ship with their own version of Xerces and I think we should use those. I m not really sure why we have a dependency on Xerces at all. The dependency probably could should be removed. Time for a new improvement issue... See also JCR-367 and JCR-602 that got rid of the dependency from jackrabbit-core.The Xerces dependency might still be needed for JCR-19 The Xerces dependency might still be needed for JCR-19 JCR-19 has been superceded by JCR-367 which in turn led to JCR-602 so this is not an issue here.
