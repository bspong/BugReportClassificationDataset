SPI Describe equality requirements of ItemIds
Michael Duerig asked for clarification regarding the equality of ItemIds. While discussing this we came to the following conclusion Two ItemIds should be considered equal if both the unique part and the path part are equal AND if they denote the same type of id see denotesNode . If nobody objects i would adjust the javadoc of ItemId accordingly.if nobody objects within the next couple of hours i will assume lazy consensus and commit the clarification as stated above .
