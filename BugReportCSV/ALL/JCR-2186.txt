Unnecessary hasItemState call in SessionItemStateManager
At the end of SessionItemStateManager.getItemState ItemId the underlying item state manager is first asked whether it contains the item and then it is retrieved. In case the item state manager does not know the item a NoSuchItemStateException is thrown. The initial check is unnecessary because getItemState on the underlying manager will also throw the exception if the item does not exist.Implemented in revision 791255Merged to the 1.x branch in revision 791861.
