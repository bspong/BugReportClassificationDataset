RangeQuery RangeFilter used with collation seek to lowerTerm using compareTo 
The constructor for RangeTermEnum initializes a TermEnum starting with lowerTermText but when a collator is defined all terms in the given field need to be checked since collation can introduce non-Unicode orderings. Instead the RangeTermEnum constructor should test for a non-null collator and if there is one point the TermEnum at the first term in the given field. LUCENE-1424 introduced this bug. This patch modifies the RangeTermEnum constructor as described and includes Danish tests in TestRangeQuery TestRangeFilter and TestMultiTermConstantScore illustrating the problem Ð these tests fail without the patch and succeed with it applied. Urgh sorry Thanks for catching this Steve. I will commit shortly. Committed revision 713332. Thanks Steve Good tests thanks. My bad for missing that when copying rangefilter logic.
