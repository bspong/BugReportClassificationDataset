Some contrib packages are missing a package.html
Dunno if we will get to this one this release but a few contribs don t have a package.html or a good overview that would work as a replacement - I don t think this is hugely important but I think it is important - you should be able to easily and quickly read a quick overview for each contrib I think. So far I have identified collation and spatial. also db and remote Here is package.html for contrib collation with content mostly stolen from class comments and test cases. The Turkish collation example is mostly stolen from Robert Muir s TestTurkishCollation.java from LUCENE-1581. Steven thanks I think this writeup really is hugely important for this package. the existing javadocs assumes you know what collation does and the changes entry really understates what you can do with this 2. LUCENE-1435 Added contrib collation a CollationKeyFilter allowing you to convert tokens into CollationKeys encoded usign IndexableBinaryStringTools. This allows for faster RangQuery when a field needs to use a custom Collator. Steven Rowe via Mike McCandless So I think its good for someone to understand they can use this package for more than just range queries sorting and searching Steven Rowe s supplied docs for collation plus some package.htmls for a couple more contribs. You want to take this issue Robert Mark sure. I would absolutely love it if someone who has a good understanding of spatial could comment on what the packages do I will create the html files and update the patch added package.htmls for the two user-level spatial pkgs tier and geohash plan to commit this patch tomorrow. Committed revision 810923. thanks Steven
