extensibility changes to SimpleWebdavServlet
the new SimpleWebdavServlet class lost some of the extensibility of the old WebdavServlet that allowed subclasses to ignore the dependency on RepositoryAccessServlet and provide their own support objects. attached is a patch that adds back these qualities.sorry for that i will readd the missing set-methods. since we now have a SessionProvider for repository sessions and a DavSessionProvider for the Webdav Sessions i will rename the corresponding setter and getters to make it clear... currently the naming is somehow confusing. thanks for the patch and for reporting angelareintroduces the missing set-methods. Please Note for consistency reasons and clarity i renamed the following methods - SessionProvider sessionProvider    getSessionProvider was getRepositorySessionProvider    setSessionProvider missing before - DavSessionProvider davSessionProvider    getDavSessionProvider was getSessionProvider    setDavSessionProvider missing before please apologize for the inconveniences regards angelapatch. NOTE also - moves JCRConstants from the webdav-project to commons we forgot that one - core.query.QueryConstants use Constants interface instead of NamespaceRegistryImpl thanks for applying.
