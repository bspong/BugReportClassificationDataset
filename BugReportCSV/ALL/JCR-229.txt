Decouple packages in core.query
The packages o.a.j.c.query has cyclic dependencies to sub packages lucene sql xpath. Decoupling the packages will allow to better extend the query implementation with additional query languages.TextPlainTextFilter moved to sub package o.a.j.c.query.lucene because it only works with lucene implementation of a query handler.. Introduced interface QueryTreeBuilder that allows to implement arbitrary syntax that can be represented with a QueryNode tree specified in package o.a.j.c.query. XPath and SQL syntax are now implemented via this interface. svn revision 292675
