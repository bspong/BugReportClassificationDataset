Jcr-Server Improve implementation of DavResource getProperty DavPropertyName 
this issue has already been described in JCR-397 problem even if only a subset of properties has been requested by the client dav resource initializes the complete set of properties.fixed in the server-side implementation of the jcr-remoting which makes intensive use of protected and calculated properties. note that for this fix the definition of DavResource getProperties was relaxed from returns all properties to at least all properties exposed in allprop the multistatus response was slightly adjusted to makes sure allprop-include requests are still properly processed.
