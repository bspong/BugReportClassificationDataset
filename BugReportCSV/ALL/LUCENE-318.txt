 System Properties doc lists lockDir instead of lockdir 
The System Properties documentation page states that the lock file directory can be set with the system property org.apache.lucene.lockDir . However as implemented in org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory line 56 the property name is actually org.apache.lucene.lockdir lower case d in lockdir . Recommend changing documentation to match code. Michael i just reviewed and committed your change thanks for your sharp eye. It will be online when the next update of the webpage is done. thanks Bernhard
