Add generics to DocumentsWriterDeleteQueue.Node
DocumentsWriterDeleteQueue.Note should be generic as the subclasses hold different types of items. This generification is a little bit tricks but the generics policeman can t wait to fix this g. Huperduper¨ generics patch. This compiles without unsafe warnings in javac 1.5 - Eclipse may complain more - but javac 1.5 is what counts for the generics policman. Eclipse compiler warns about one synthetic access method on Simon s original code we should also remove Access to enclosing constructor DocumentsWriterDeleteQueue.Node T T is emulated by a synthetic accessor method Fixed in this patch. Eclipse also complains generics wise raw Node access in ReferenceUpdater declaration but this is just too picky and cannot be solved because of .class constructs . Yes Sir Mr. Generics Policeman looks good Committed trunk revision 1100239
