 PATCH new method Document.remove 
Here s a patch that adds a remove method to the Document class test case . This is very useful if you have converter classes that return a Lucene Document object but you need to make changes to that object. In my case I wanted to index PDF files that were saved as BLOBs in a database. The files need to be saved to a temporary file and that file name is given to the PDF converter class. The PDF converter then saves the name of the temporary file name as the file name which doesn t make sense. So my code needs to remove the filename field and re-add it this time with the columns primary ID. This is only possible with the attached patch. Created an attachment id 11274 new Document.remove method Created an attachment id 11275 test case for the remove method This seems to be a useful idea. Instead of one remove method I added a removeField and a removeFields . Additional methods cannot break any old applications. The document API is quite simple and remove does not add much complexity to it.
