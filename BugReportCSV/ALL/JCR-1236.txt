New Jackrabbit site skin
Some time ago Michael Eppelheimer from Day created a new skin for the Jackrabbit web site and I ve now streamlined it a bit and integrated it with the Maven site build mechanism. The templates should be easy to adapt also for Confluence when we get around to that migration.Attached a patch with the required changes to jackrabbit-site except new logo images . The new skin can be seen at http people.apache.org jukka 2007 JCR-1236 If you like it I ll commit the changes in a few days.What s the reason for changing the skin I like the old one better than the new one.There s no need to change if people prefer the current look. 1 for the change i prefer the new designThe Confluence export uses the new skin with some modifications. Resolving as Fixed.
