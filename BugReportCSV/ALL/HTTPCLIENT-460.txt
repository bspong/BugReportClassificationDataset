Windows specific implementation of the Digest auth scheme
Microsoft Windows 2003 implementation of digest auth scheme is essentially a superset of RFC 2617 with Windows specific aspects http www.microsoft.com technet prodtechnol windowsserver2003 library TechRef 717b450c-f4a0-4cc9-86f4-cc0633aae5f9.mspx Provide a super class of DigestScheme with Windows 2003 specific extensions which can be plugged in instead of the standard Digest impl For details see PR 34909I have taken a closer look at Microsoft s How Digest Authentication Works document and found their extensions of the standard protocol to be rather benign contrary to my initial assertion. It appears that the only significant extension is introduction of charset attribute that defines char encoding of user credentials which sort of makes sense. I think there s no need to provide a Windows specific auth scheme just because of that. I just ended up patching the standard DigestScheme to make use of charset attribute when present OlegCreated an attachment id 15087 Patch take1 Please review and let me know what you think OlegLooks good to me. Again the only addition would be a test case MikeI could not think of any meaningful test case. I committed the patch as is Oleg
