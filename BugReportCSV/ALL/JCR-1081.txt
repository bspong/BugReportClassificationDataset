bad test assumptions in org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.lock
These tests make a lot of assumptions that may not be true for a compliant repository such as - ability to add nodes without specifiying the node type - assumption that ordering and same name siblings are supported - assumption that addMixin lockable is required on newly added nodes Furthermore some repositories may not support shallow locks on leaf nodes. That s not compliant but failure to do so should not abort a test that tests something else. Fixed with revision 568942. Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 577859.
