Query scorers should not use MultiFields
Lucene does all searching filtering per-segment today but there are a number of tests that directly invoke Scorer.scorer or Filter.getDocIdSet on a composite reader. Attached patch. Only a few query impls were affected but many tests were directly passing composite readers to the low level API. I added a new helper class SlowMultiReaderWrapper that one can use to wrap an existing composite reader to make it inefficiently pretend it s an atomic reader. Forgot to resolve this...
