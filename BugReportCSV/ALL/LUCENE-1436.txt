Make ReqExclScorer package private and use DocIdSetIterator for excluded part.
This also prepares for using Filters as clauses in BooleanQuery Paul this is technically a change in back-compat since it s a public class that this patch makes package private . Are you thinking it s just very unlikely this is used by anything except BooleanScorer2 We also have at least ReqOptSumScorer and maybe others which is public. I just hope this does not collide with LUCENE-1614. Note that in the follow-up issue to 1614 the number is yet to be generated I intend to change the logic in ReqExclScorer so that it conforms to the new semantics of DISI. Why do we need to make this class package-private Any particular reason besides not needing to worry about changes to back-compat in the future This should only affect external code that uses the ReqExclScorer class. From the amount of reactions on that so far I think such code probably does not exist. The move to DocIdSetIterator superclass of Scorer can be done because no score values are used on the excluded part. This is only a consequence of the extraction of the DocIdSetIterator superclass from Scorer. So I don t expect LUCENE-1614 or new semantics of DISI to collide with this. Also I don t expect LUCENE-1614 to collide with LUCENE-1345 that allows filter as clause to boolean query. Some time ago DisjunctionSumScorer was made private in a similar way. ReqOptSumScorer could also be made package private perhaps even at the same time as ReqExclScorer. The reason to make things package private is to have more freedom to change things lateron that are not really part of the public api now. OK why don t we make both package private Are there other classes BooleanScorer 2 are using that should be made package private I m assuming the answer to my last question was no so I ll go ahead and make these 2 classes package private.
