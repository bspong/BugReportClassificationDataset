Download improve user experience
The download section at http jackrabbit.apache.org downloads.html contains many files. The number of files should be reduced. Some of them contain other files for example the .rar files and the .war files. The file jackrabbit-jca-1.4.rar contains an old version of jackrabbit-core jackrabbit-core-1.4.jar - however the newest version of jackrabbit-core is jackrabbit-core-1.4.5.jar This often leads to problems.See http markmail.org message wmlmwverjt7ymlqp for my proposed solution to this issue starting from Jackrabbit 1.5. The 1.5 downloads are already much better in this respect. Resolving as Fixed.
