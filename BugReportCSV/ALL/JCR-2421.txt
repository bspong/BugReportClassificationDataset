Unable to create repository using jackrabbit-webapp because a directory called jackrabbit already exists
I mount the jackrabbit-webapp.war in a Jetty installation at startup i have the following exception ERROR RepositoryStartupServlet Either create thejackrabbit bootstrap.properties file or ERROR RepositoryStartupServlet use the config index.jsp for easy configuration. ERROR RepositoryStartupServlet RepositoryStartupServlet initializing failed javax.servlet.ServletException Repository startup configuration is not valid. then when i access http localhost 8080 i am forwarded to the page Êhttp localhost 8080 bootstrap missing.jsp creating the repository by clicking on Create Content Repository button fails complaining that the jackrabbit directory already exists Indeed i find a jackrabbit directory in my JETTY HOME from where is started Jetty . A workaround is to delete this jackrabbit directory and then i can create the repository by clicking on the previous button and therefore access the newly created repository.The jackrabbit tmp directory is created by the JcrRemotingServlet servlet from jackrabbit-jcr-server component at servlet init. But the Installer class from jackrabbit-webapp test if the repository home already exists before creating it and is by default jackrabbit . So I see three solutions here use a different home directory in JcrRemotingServlet servlet but this will not be backward compatible as we change default settings use a different home directory in Installer but this will not be backward compatible as we change default settings check if a specific file folder exists like REPO HOME repository instead of checking the whole repository home directory. I think the last one is the less intrusive. WDYT I think the last one is the less intrusive. 1Proposed patch using the third solution. The only drawback is that a custom repository.xml may not use a LocalFileSystem with path set to rep.home repository but FWIR configTemplate uses org apache jackrabbit core repository.xml and is not configurable.Patch applied in revision 889133.Merged to the 1.6 branch in revision 889136.
