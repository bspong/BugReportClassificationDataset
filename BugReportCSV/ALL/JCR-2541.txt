spi2dav EventJournal not implemented
i didn t look at the details just realized that all EventJournalTest of the TCK fail in the setup jcr2spi - spi2dav ex - jcr-server. i assume that this is due to missing implementation the corresponding SPI method throws UnsupportedRepositoryOperationException .If I understand correctly we ll need a new variant of SUBSCRIBE POLL UNSUBSCRIBE for this right I discussed this with Marcel last week summary - implement the EventJournal as a feed resource - filtering happens client-side same as for observation - feed format would be Atom RFC 4287 unless there s a strong reason not to - getting events since can be implemented using the If-None-Match Vary using the timestamp as etag To be discussed discovery of the feed URI Work in progress implementation of EventJournal as Atom feed. Entry details missing consumer side missing as well.Proposed patch.Updated patch cleaned up and somewhat prepared for PERSIST events Proposed patch compatible with PERSIST events but not taking advantage of them yetProposed patch.Updated patch incl. more documentation and enhanced DomUtil functionality in order to reduce namespace noise.
