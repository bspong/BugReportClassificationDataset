Improve lifecycle management of JCA connector
the shutdown mechanism doesn t work correctly. It shutdowns the repository when the RA resource adapter is garbage collected. It causes redeployment to fail because sometimes the new RA is redeployed before the old one is garbage collected. Implementing the JCA 1.5 interface to manage the lifecycle would be useful.A ResourceAdapter implementation was added. It slightly changes the default behaviour for JCA 1.0. On startup it turns off the auto repository shutdown. On close it shutdowns all the open repositories. It shouldn t break the compatibility with JCA 1.0 if it does please reopen the issue.
