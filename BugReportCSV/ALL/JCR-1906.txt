Make observation polling time configurable
Currently the polling time is hard coded to 3 seconds in org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.WorkspaceImpl. I suggest to make it configurable similar to CacheBehaviour. That is add a respective setting to org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.config.RepositoryConfigProposed patchPatch looks good.
