search.jsp doesn t handle utf-8 parameters correctly
1. I cannot use WebDav client to uploaded a file whose name is in Chinese. The file name I had is .txt and the uploaded command by the WebDav client did something like    Outbound Message PUT op ED EF 3A.txt HTTP 1.1 Host localhost 8080  The server didn t decode it correctly the result is the file name got screwed and the file content was not uploaded. 2. In the default web.war module there is search.jsp for rendering the search page. If I type Chinese text in the search box search.jsp does not decode the input parameter from ISO-8859-1 to utf-8 and in turn the search engine searches wrong string. 3. The search engine does do search correctly if I hardcode the query variable in search.jsp or do decoding the query parameter from ISO-885901 to utf-8.  More information After more experiments I found my WebDav client and most of others don t handle the encoding correctly they didn t encode the command in utf-8. I tried to use Microsoft Vista folder and it correctly handles the uploading problem. It is not Jackrabbit WebDav s problem.    The only thing left is the search.jsp. I m not sure this is the problem for Jackrabbit. It is probably more general problem for jsp or web broswer IE and FireFox why is the parameter sent from the clients not encoded in utf-8 even the page is specifically a utf-8 page   Anyway this becomes a minor problem and can be worked around.  Fixed in revision 655780 Thank you for reporting this issue.
