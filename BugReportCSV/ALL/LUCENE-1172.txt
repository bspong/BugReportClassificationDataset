Small speedups to DocumentsWriter
Some small fixes that I found while profiling indexing Wikipedia mainly using our own quickSort instead of Arrays.sort. Testing first 200K docs of Wikipedia shows a speedup from 274.6 seconds to 270.2 seconds. I ll commit in a day or two. The above numbers were with the full docs from Wikipedia. I expect the optimization to be more effective with smaller docs so I ran test to index first 10 million small 100 characters Wikpedia docs. Trunk took 257.5 sec best of 3 and patch took 246.9 sec best of 3 4.1 speedup.
