Allow TaskSequence to run for certain time
To help the perf testing for LUCENE-1483 I added simple ability to specify a fixed run time seconds for a task sequence eg XSearchWithSort SearchWithSort doctitle string 2.7s iterates on that subtask until 2.7 seconds have elapsed and then sets the repetition count to how many iterations were done. This is useful when you are running searches whose runtime may vary drastically. I plan to commit in a day or so. Committed revision 728252.
