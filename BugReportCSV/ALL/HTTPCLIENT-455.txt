Feature Request include contributed code for Plugin Proxy Detection
Attached is a zip file containing two classes - PluginProxyUtil and ProxyDetectionException. I ve tested PluginProxyUtil.detectProxy URL on Windows XP JRE s 1.3 1.4 1.5 with IE and Solaris JRE 1.4 with Netscape and it correctly detects browser plugin settings. I don t have access to MacOS X to try it but I doubt that it works there anyway based on Dmitri s comments here http forum.java.sun.com thread.jspa threadID 364342 tstart 120 Please change the header and package as necessary to include it in the contrib section. I plan to contribute an example Applet that uses this code at some point - our app is way too complicated to use as an example. If you want to wait until that is done to include it that s fine too. Just wanted to offer this up now in case anyone else is looking for it.Created an attachment id 14949 source files for Java Plugin proxy detection on multiple VM s Reasonable to put it in contrib. The original code was posted in a public forum and may therefore be considered public domain. Should be no problem to publish it under the ASF license.Created an attachment id 15656 source files for Java Plugin proxy detection on multiple VM s Folks Any objections to adding these classes to the contrib package If I hear no complaints within a couple of days I ll commit the patch OlegLooks good to me. It should be a nice addition to contrib. MikePatch committed. Oleg
