Codec is not consistently passed in internal API
While working on SOLR-1942 I ran into a couple of glitches with codec which is not consistently passed to SegmentsInfo and friends. Codecs should really be consistently passed though. I have fixed the pieces which lead to errors in Solr but I guess there might be others too. Patch is coming up... here are the findings - there should be a test catching this really here is an updated patch I changed all occurrences of SegmentInfos to use the given codec I will commit this if nobody objects... Committed revision 1031066.
