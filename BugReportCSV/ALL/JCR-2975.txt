Make ItemInfoBuilder name space aware
Currently there is no way to to have NodeInfoBuilder PropertyInfoBuilder build NodeInfos ItemInfos on a name space other than the default one. I suggest to add appropriate methods to NodeInfoBuilder PropertyInfoBuilder to set the name space.Fixed at revision 1127533
