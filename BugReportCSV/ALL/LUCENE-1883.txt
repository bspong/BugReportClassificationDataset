Fix typos in CHANGES.txt and contrib CHANGES.txt prior to 2.9 release
I noticed a few typos in CHANGES.txt and contrib CHANGES.txt. Once they make it past a release they re set in stone... Will attach a patch shortly. patch with typos corrected Once they make it past a release they re set in stone.. Why I searched just now but couldn t find an email thread I recall on java-dev between Doug Cutting and the RM at that point several years ago about modifying past releases CHANGES.txt entries. Doug s position articulated both in that thread and elsewhere IIRC was that people depend on being able to do a diff between CHANGES.txt versions so once a release was cut the release notes should never change thereafter. interesting - someone forgot to put up the sign I ve posted a back spell fix before that was applied wasn t me it was before someone was nuts enough to give me write access to Lucene Thanks a lot for the patch - you ve got some eagle eyes man - I wouldn t have caught those name misspellings. hmm - got marked invalid - weird - reopen to resolve right
