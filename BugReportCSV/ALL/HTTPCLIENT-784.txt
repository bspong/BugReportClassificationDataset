Multipart post is broken
I tried to do HttpPost request with MultipartEntity this request was encoded to wire with 3 line separators after header and not processed correctly by http server. MultipartEntry add 1 extra line separator before write itself to wire. I m not sure about standards but it is at least not browser compatible . Alexey Please produce a wirelog of the HTTP packet s generated by HttpClient and a Wireshark packet dump of HTTP packet s generated by the browser. OlegRequest from Firefox 3 and similar request from HttpClientFixed in SVN trunk. Oleg
