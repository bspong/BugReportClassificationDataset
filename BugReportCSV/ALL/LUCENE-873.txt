nightly builds depend on clover
as reported by Michael Pelz Sherman on java-dev lucene and solr-user lucene the nightly builds coming out of hudson current depend on clover... root crm.test.bbhmedia.net tmp strings lucene-core-nightly.jar grep -i clover more org apache lucene LucenePackage CLOVER 0 0.class org apache lucene analysis Analyzer CLOVER 1 0.class ... the old nightly.sh dealt with this by running ant nightly twice first without clover to get the jars and then with clover to get the report. it loks like maybe this logic never made it into the hudson setup. someone with hudson admin access knowledge will need to look into this. On or around April 9th I changed the build to use the old nightly.sh script but slightly modified . The main modification was that I commented out the copy of the docs and tar files to the release server since Hudson takes care of publishing these now . Unforunately this meant that the subsequent clover build further down in the script over-wrote the tar files with clover references which Hudson then archives once the script completes. I ve rearranged the script to run clover first then the regular build. I ve run a new build and it seems to be fixed. Verified this today. Thanks Nigel This is fixed and verified.
