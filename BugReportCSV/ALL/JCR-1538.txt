 patch add toString for NodeImpl and PropertyImpl
add toString for NodeImpl and PropertyImpl with new format. see how it is liked before adding more.Hi The patch looks good but maybe it can still be improved. Your implementation calls quite heavyweight methods that can throw RepositoryException. Maybe they throw unchecked exceptions as well I recently had a problem with NullPointerException in a toString method . Catching Exception instead of just RepositoryException would be safer I guess. What about appending super.toString in all cases even if no exception occurs That way you could detect it s the same object before and after the session is closed. Regards Thomasi agree with thomas that only methods should be used that do not throw an exception and do not alter the state item.getName does . I would also stay away from resolving namespaces but return the namespace URI and the local name of a Name. Well that actually means calling toString on a Name which is probably a good pattern.I made some related but less complex improvements in revisions 691296 and 691305. All items now return their type node or property and safe path as the toString output.Completed in revision 698402. All ItemImpl descendants now have toString methods that return a string like type path using safeGetJCRPath for the path part. Also I replaced all calls to safeGetJCRPath with the toString method in diagnostics output. The result is more readable for example      failed to add property name to safeGetJCRPath vs.      failed to add property name to this failed to add property name to this Wouldn t it be nice if Java supported stuff like failed to add property name to this . Perhaps we should switch to Groovy. -
