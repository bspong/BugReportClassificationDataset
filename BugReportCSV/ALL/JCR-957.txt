Set jcr and servlet-api dependency scope to provided
The jcr and servlet API libraries should typically be provided by the deployment environment and not included as compile runtime dependencies of Jackrabbit artifacts. The scope of those dependencies should thus be set to provided in the dependencyManagement section of the Jackrabbit parent POM.Scope changed in revision 543806.
