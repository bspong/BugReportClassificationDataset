Align the code base with checkstyle
The style use in HttpClient is still quite inconsistant. checkstyle should be used to align the code base to a similar style. The checkstyle report can be found at http jakarta.apache.org commons httpclient checkstyle-report.html And can be generated with maven checkstyle generate-reportCreated an attachment id 4559 First patch towards cleaning up the warnings Good start. Committed patch 01 27 03 11 16 except for the chunk where you were changing something in commons.lang I added a checkstyle.properties so that we can can have a some control over what the style is. It is currently just using the default but is now very strict with regards to the license. Also ignores the long line Header from header so we can have fully checkstyle compliant files with no warnings. You can ignore any errors that come from the license in files that have not been cleaned up yet I can take care of those.Created an attachment id 4572 Round two of the cleanup Created an attachment id 4603 Round three of the cleanup. Still lots of files to go. Committed round 2 and round 3. Almost there ...Created an attachment id 4636 Round 4 of the cleanup Committed round 4. We are getting a bunch of deprecation warnings surrounding HttpUrlMethod. This is good. Those deprecated Url methods should be removed before we get to a final release.Created an attachment id 4651 This finishes all the simple warnings. I d call this feature complete. There are still some non-compliant classes like URI but these are slated to be factored into their own package. The remaining violations are generally useful such as TODO comments and will be corrected over time.
