LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket should have access to HttpParams
We use a custom implementation of LayeredSchemeSocketFactory that manages a keystore location through HttpParams. That allows us to use different keystores on a per connection basis. When a proxy is used LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket is invoked which does not have a parameter that passes the HttpParams along. In consequence certificate authentication fails in our implementation. Is there a reason why all other factory methods in the super class have an HttpParams parameter except for LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket The downstream bug is here 369805 certificate authentication with custom keystore fails behind proxy https bugs.eclipse.org bugs show bug.cgi id 369805 Any input would be greatly appreciated.Long time no speak. There is no good reason. What we can do is to deprecate LayeredSchemeSocketFactory interface and create a new one say LayeringSchemeSocketFactory or some such and provide a compatibility layer for LayeredSchemeSocketFactory similar to that for LayeredSocketFactory. OlegGreat to hear from you I was hoping for that answer . It sounds like a good proposal to me.Fixed in SVN trunk. Please review. OlegThanks The changes look very good to me.
