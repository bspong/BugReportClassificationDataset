SegmentTermEnum.next doesn t maintain prevBuffer at end
When you re iterating a SegmentTermEnum and you go past the end of the docs you end up with a state where the nextBuffer null and the prevBuffer is the penultimate term not the last term. This patch fixes it. It s also required for my Prefetching bug LUCENE-506 Index java org apache lucene index SegmentTermEnum.java Ñ java org apache lucene index SegmentTermEnum.java revision 382121 java org apache lucene index SegmentTermEnum.java working copy -109 6 109 7 Increments the enumeration to the next element. True if one exists. public final boolean next throws IOException if position size - 1 prevBuffer.set termBuffer termBuffer.reset return false I have a unit test showing this ... will commit fix shortly. I just committed this. Thanks Steven Thanks -Steven You re welcome And sorry it took such a crazy long time...
