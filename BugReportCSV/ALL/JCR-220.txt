Make it possible to configure Lucene Analyzer for SearchIndex
Jackrabbit does not support the specification of a Lucene analyzer class org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer to be used by a SearchIndex or other Lucene based indices declared in an XML configuration file. Custom analyzer is useful for indexing language specific content.Fixed in revision 312842. The analyzer class can now be specified using the analyzer parameter in search configuration. For now it is not possible to specify stop words or any other analyzer-specific configuration.Property analyzer is not set because there is no public getAnalyzer method. Fixed in revision 330270
