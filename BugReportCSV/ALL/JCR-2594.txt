Make cache limits configurable
The cache settings of the CacheManager class JCR-619 can be adjusted programmatically JCR-725 but it would be nice if there was also a way to set them with system properties or ideally as a part of the repository configuration.In revision 931838 I added support for the following system properties     org.apache.jackrabbit.maxCacheMemory - max memory used for all caches in bytes default 16MB     org.apache.jackrabbit.maxMemoryPerCache - max memory used for a single cache in bytes default 4MB     org.apache.jackrabbit.minMemoryPerCache - min memory used for a single cache in bytes default 128kB     org.apache.jackrabbit.cacheResizeInterval - cache resize interval in ms default 1s Merged to the 2.1 branch in revision 931840.
