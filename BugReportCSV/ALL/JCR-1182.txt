Put everything in jackrabbit-spi-commons under org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.commons
To avoid confusion and naming conflicts we should put all classes and packages in jackrabbit-spi-commons under org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.commons.if you want to do that fine by me. just let me commit a couple of changes before in order to avoid conflicts.Angela any pending changes in spi-commons i don t have anything pending in any of the spi-projects or only insignificant ones .OK thanks. I will proceed with the proposed restructuring tonight.Packages moved in revision 605147. The dependent packages in trunk were also updated and I ll still take a look at the spi components in sandbox.
