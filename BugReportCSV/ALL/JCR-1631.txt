Replace commons-logging dependency with SLF4J
The poi dependency in jackrabbit-text-extractors brings in a transitive dependency to commons-logging. Since we use SLF4J for all logging we should exclude the commons-logging dependency and replace it with jcl104-over-slf4j.Resolved in revisions 661758 poi and 661754 poi-scratchpad .As noted in JCR-1751 it might actually be a better idea not to exclude the commons-logging dependency at this level. Instead we should let the client application decide what to do with the transitive logging dependencies.Attached a proposed patch that reverts the previous changes and moves the commons-logging exclusion to the higher level projects jackrabbit-jca and jackrabbit-webapp. 1With the proposed change this becomes a webapp and jca issue instead of text-extractors one.Patch applied in revision 698478. Resolving as Fixed.
