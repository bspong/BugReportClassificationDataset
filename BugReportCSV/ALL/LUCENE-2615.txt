DirectIOLinuxDirectory hardwires buffer size and creates files with invalid permissions
TestDemo fails if I use the DirectIOLinuxDirectory using Robert s new -Dtests.directory XXX because when it O CREATs a file it fails to specify the mode so depending on C stack you can get permission denied. Also we currently hardwire the buffer size to 1 MB Mark found this ... I plan to add a forcedBufferSize to the DirectIOLinuxDir s ctor to optionally override lucene s default buffer sizes which are way too small for direct IO to get barely OK performance . If you pass 0 for this then you get Lucene s default buffer sizes... Attached patch I ll commit shortly. Bulk close for 3.1
