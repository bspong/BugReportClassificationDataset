Improvements to user management
Container issue for various improvements needed for the user management implementation in jr-core. Known improvements are - extensibility - current structuring of users groups in the JCR content doesn t allow for easy finding user group by ID. - groupID should be unescaped before being returned by getIDAllow subclasses of UserManagerImpl UserImpl for custom implementations in revision 792467.Changed structure of user group content in rev. 794702. The default behavior of the UserManager can be influenced by setting a couple of options in the security configuration. For minimal backwards compatitibility with pre-2.0 user content the compatibleJR16 option must be set to true. In this case UserManager getAuthorizable String ID will try to retrieve authorizables using the noderesolver if not found otherwise. See UserManagerImpl for further details.in addition moved interfaces for repo based principals to the api in rev. 794718
