Checking of stale connections is broken
HttpConnections that went stale dropped by server throw SocketExceptions instead of silently re-opening themselves as has been the case with earlier versions of HttpClient. I think the problem for this can be found in HttpConnection   public boolean closeIfStale throws IOException     if used isOpen isStale       LOG.debug Connection is stale closing...       close       return true          return false    staleness is only checked if used true but there is no code in HttpConnection that sets the used flag. In other words used is always false and isStale is never called.The code that used to set used flag to true has been removed sometime past the 3.0 ALPHA1 release. Expect a patch by the end of the week or even much sooner OlegCreated an attachment id 13902 Patch The patch solves my problemsPatch committed. Many thanks Oliver Oleg
