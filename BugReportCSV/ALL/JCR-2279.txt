Improve reusability of AbstractRepositoryService and AbstractReadableRepositoryService
Much of the functionality in AbstractReadableRepositoryService is not specific to reading but rather applies to any implementation node types name spaces descriptors . I suggest to pull this functionality up from AbstractReadableRepositoryService to AbstractRepositoryServiceFixed in revision 808006
