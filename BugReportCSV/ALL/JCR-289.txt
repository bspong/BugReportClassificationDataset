jcr-server make auth-header configurable for JCR-Server
In WEB-INF web.xml there is a section commented-out by default that reads          init-param              param-name authenticate-header param-name              param-value Basic realm Jackrabbit Webdav Server param-value              description                 Defines the value of the WWW-Authenticate header.              description          init-param This parameter is ignored not loaded by the code - the default string is always used instead Note this was more of a problem before JCR-286 had been fixed Hmm publish and be damned they say... It seems my asserion is not 100 correct. The section does get read and acted upon when accessing ... jackrabbit-server repository but has NO EFFECT on ... jackrabbit-server server This might well be working as designed . I suspect therefore that the code is working as designed. However it would be nice if it were possible to set the authenticate-header on the JCRWebdavServer servlet as well and for the configuration to be present but commented out in web.xml just like the Webdav servlet. hi peter right... the auth-header currently is only configurable for the simple server. but of cause that a trivial change to make it available for the other servlet too. adjusted the summary accordingly and reset the type to new feature . kind regards angelafixed rev. 368754
