Make HighFreqTerms.TermStats class public
It s not possible to use public methods in contrib misc ... HighFreqTerms from outside the package because the return type has package visibility. I propose to move TermStats class to a separate file and make it public. Patch with the change. If there are no objections I ll commit this shortly. 1 Just wondering if you could describe the use you have in mind. Tom I use this class in Luke which admittedly is not a common use case I guess you could use it also to obtain a list of common words that are good candidates for shingling in the future the common grams method . Anyway as it is now the API is simply inconsistent - public methods return instances of a package-private class - so either we close the API completely or we take this small additional step to open it for other creative uses. Actually I m inclined to make this a static inner class instead of a separate class to avoid polluting the package with classes that are not tools. Fixed in trunk in rev. 1001664.
