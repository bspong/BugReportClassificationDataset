MalformedCookieException distinguish cookie syntax errors from cross-domain errors
MalformedCookieException is used for both cookies with syntax errors and for cookies which are invalid for the particular context - e.g. cross-domain cookies. I think it would be helpful to be able to distinguish these without needing to examine the message text.Sebastian Standard cookie specs now distinguish between format syntax errors and violations of restrictions imposed by a particular cookie specification. CookieSpec validate methods now throw CookieRestrictionViolationException exception instead of MalformedCookieException in the latter case. Please review and let me know if that fixes the problem for you. OlegThat looks very good - thanks for fixing this.
