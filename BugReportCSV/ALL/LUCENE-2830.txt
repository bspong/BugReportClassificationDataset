Use StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer in benchmark
Minor change - use StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer in benchmark s code. We don t need the synchronization of StringBuffer in all the places that I ve checked. The only place where it could be a problem is in HtmlParser s API - one method accepts a StringBuffer and it s an interface. But I think it s ok to change benchmark s API back-compat wise and so I d like to either change it to accept a String or remove the method altogether Ð no code in benchmark uses it and if anyone needs it he can pass StringReader to the other method. Patch replaces StringBuffer with StringBuilder. I did not yet remove the parse method from HtmlParser - if people are ok with it I ll remove it. For now I changed the parameter to String. All tests pass. Since parse StringBuffer is not used and whoever wants to use it can use the Reader variant and pass new StringReader I removed it. I plan to commit tomorrow.
