TCK RestoreTest.testRestoreLabel
According to tobi the jackrabbit implementation of Node.restoreByLabel is an interpretation of the specification regarding the restore behaviour of versionable child nodes. while that interpetration might be legal unless the specification is violated i would argue that the TCK should not test the interpretation. therefore i suggest to modify org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.version.RestoreTest.testRestoreLabel by skipping line 334 - 345 in order to limit the test case to the behaviour that is defined by the specification. regards angela ps the mentioned test is also executed within the scope of WorkspaceRestoreTest because the latter extends RestoreTest.... that s misleading.Changed the test to only focus on a single versionable node. Fixed in revision 553510Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 577813.
