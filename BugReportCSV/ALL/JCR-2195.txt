Provide possibility to import protected items using Session import functionality
SessionImporter and WorkspaceImporter currently skip all protected items encountered during import except for some special cases see JCR-2172 and WorkspaceImporter postProcessNode . The specification only mandates that protected content is treated in a consistent manner but allows the implementation to either import or ignore it. Find attached a patch containing some initials steps to allow to extend the default import behavior Instead of skipping protected items and in case of nodes the complete tree below it they should be passed to a separate handler that may or may not be able to deal with them and needs to assert that they are in a valid format. The patch includes - Abstract classes for that protected item import - Default implementations that never import protected nodes same behavior as we have today - An example implementation for the AC-content just to see if it works for simple cases some trivial tests. - Changes to SessionImporter to demonstrate how import of protected items would be enabled. The patch doesn t include yet - Changes to WorkspaceImporter would - be according to SessionImporter - Changes to WorkspaceImpl SessionImpl as well as configuration that would allow to modify the default behavior. - Examples for import of protected properties. - Examples for workspace import. The patch has the following limitations or TODOs - Proper handling of protected references properties or non-protected ref properties with the tree defined by a protected node. - Test Careful review if the various ImportUUIDBehaviors are can properly be covered specially in case of replace-existing . The patch in addition addresses - An inconsistency in the SessionImporter    Attempt to import protected content below an existing protected node skipped    Attempt to import protected content that doesn t yet exist first node is imported ConstraintViolationException for child-nodes.    This behavior is also reflected in the Node-stack... where in the first case null is pushed in the second case the first protected node.       see also JCR-2172 for details . committed slightly modified version of the patch with the restrictions implications above.revision 810471 - reverted to original proposal without the ProtectedItemHandlers. - fixed issue when 2 ACL entries are importedrevision 828791 - add configuration to the workspace configuration - pass config to both SessionImporter and WorkspaceImporter    the latter hasn t been touched yet to support this kind of extension and throws unsupported...exc. in case    it finds configured importers that are meant to be used with a workspace import . - handling of reference properties - uuidbehavior passed to the importers TODOs - workspace importproposed patch for workspace-import according to changes made to session import. corresponding tests still missing.in order to get this issue resolved for 2.0 we have the following possibilities - implement workspace import of protected items according to the session import - see untested patch jr built not affected - leave it as is and resolve issue with the known limitations workspace importer not accepted for the time being . i don t have strong feelings about either variant but I d like to see this issue resolved for 2.0 instead of having a code released without having the corresponding issue being closed.I think we should close this issue and target the workspace import of protected items for another release.adjusting subject accordingly. was Provide possibility to import protected items using Session Workspace import functionalityresolving issue. workspace-importing protected items is not supported. we can address this if we really have need and or time to carefully test the corresponding patch.
