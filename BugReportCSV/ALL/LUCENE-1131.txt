Add numDeletedDocs to IndexReader
Add numDeletedDocs to IndexReader. Basically the implementation is as simple as doing public int numDeletedDocs return deletedDocs null 0 deletedDocs.count in SegmentReader. Patch to follow to include in all IndexReader extensions. How about just using maxDoc - numDocs This is an option however it will result in two calls to maxDoc once by maxDoc and another by numDocs . Like I wrote it s more of a convenience method and having a complete and clear API. This way users of Lucene won t need to ask themselves how to obtain this number - they ll have an explicit API for that. A very simple patch that implements numDeletedDocs in all the necessary readers. I think maxDoc is a cheap call so calling it twice won t be a performance killer esp. since this is not something you d call frequently I imagine. However I do agree about numDeletedDocs being nice for hiding implementation details. Otis is this one ready to go in I think so - applies and compiles. Hmm Ð this breaks back compat adds new abstract method to IndexReader . Why don t we fallback to default impl in IndexReader of maxDoc - numDocs Patch is much less invasive and we don t break back compat maxDoc is indeed cheap. What if we implement numDeletedDocs in IndexReader instead of defining it abstract Those that extend IndexReader outside the scope of the attached patch can then choose to override the implementation or not. The purpose of the patch is to add an explicit method which developers can use rather than understand the logic on maxDoc - numDocs . Not all extended classes implement it this way BTW. SegmentReader just calls deletedDocs.count rather then calling the two separate methods. What if we implement numDeletedDocs in IndexReader instead of defining it abstract Right that s exactly what I m thinking with this body public int numDeletedDocs return maxDoc - numDocs Then I think no classes need to override it perf cost of calling 2 methods is tiny I agree with the body that s what I had in mind. As for extending classes I agree that calling two methods has little performance overhead but it just looks cleaner for SegmentReader for example . Anyway I don t have a strong opinion on whether we should override or not. I ll be fine with either.
