Item.remove fails if a child-item is not visible to the editing session
the following test setup fails - a given session is allowed to remove a node - the node has a policy child node which is not visible to the editing session missing ac-read permission   OR the node has another invisible child item which could - based on the permissions above - be removed by that session. calling Node.remove however fails with accessdeniedexception because the internal remove mechanism accesses all child items to mark them removed. however the access is executed using the regular itemmgr calls that are used to retrieve the items using the JCR API which results in accessdenied exception as those child items are not visible to the session. since the items can be removed i would argue that this is a bug in the internal remove process. attached proposed fix and test cases illustrating the problem. 1 for the patch thanks adding incomplete list of affected versions adding only major versions 2.0.0 2.1.0 2.2.0
