Provide general HTTP date parsing
Add generally accessible support for parsing HTTP dates as used in headers cookies. Initially submitted to HttpClient dev by Chris Brown.Created an attachment id 5849 patch Attached is the code submitted by Chris Brown plus some mods. Please take a look and let me know.I just noticed that this broke a test case for Netscape spec cookies. I guess the Netscape spec should not be using the DateParser. Please ignore that change.Looks good to me. Just leave the Netscape spec be. It is provided for historically inclined so it should continue using its own date parsing routine. OlegPatch applied.
