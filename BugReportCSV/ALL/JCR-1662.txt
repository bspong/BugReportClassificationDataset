Add pattern matching for paths
I suggest to add utility classes to spi-commons which can be used to do pattern matching on paths similar to regular expressions.The patch includes utility classes to match paths against patterns and test cases. A pattern is composed of elements similar to those of regular expressions i.e. sequence selection repetition .can you provide an example of how to use this pattern matching and a use case from my experience you usually only need 4 types of matching Match all foo.txt files . foo .txt Match child nodes foo . Match direct child nodes foo Match node and child nodes foo . those patterns can easily be formed with regexp.The pattern matching operates on instances of org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.Path not on strings. Matching a Path by its sting representation is problematic since it depends on the implementation. My current use case is specific to my current spi connector project. Since I have written the code anyway and it might be generally useful for spi connector implementations I provided it here. For example usage see the test cases.applied patch. please close this issue if it solves your problems.
