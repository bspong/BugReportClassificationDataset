Method to create default RepositoryConfig from just the repository directory
It would be useful to have a static method like RepositoryConfig.create File that would take the repository directory and expect to find the repository configuration in a repository.xml file inside that directory. If the directory does not exist it would be created. And if the repository configuration file does not exist then it would be created from the default configuration included in Jackrabbit.Added the following methods in revision 776310    RepositoryConfig.install File dir    RepostiroyConfig.install File xml File dir    RepositoryConfig.create File dir    RepositoryConfig.create File xml File dir The install methods will automatically create the repository directory and configuration file if they do not already exist. The create methods will fail with an exception in the same situation.
