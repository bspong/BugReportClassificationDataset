Add optional state attribute to managed client connections
Provide an optional state attribute to managed client connections. The connection state can represent a user identify in case of connection based authentication schemes such as NTLM or SSL thus allowing for connection re-use on a per user identity basis.I wanted to add this to HttpRoute and RouteTracker so it is available when connections are requested. See the auth state related comments among the route ideas http wiki.apache.org jakarta-httpclient ConnectionManagementDesign head-33536cdc185e77f8aab85785f66f7d952c0ec10b cheers   Roland TSCCM was subject to major refactoring since alpha 1. Let s give it some time to settle before extending functionality.My latest ideas would keep HttpRoute unmodifiable and instead pass authentication state as a parameter when allocating a connection. The stateful connections need an attribute with setter getter to track state. Things might get out of hand if different kind of state needs to be tracked.
