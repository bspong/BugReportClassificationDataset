Provide change log consolidator
spi-commons should provide base implementations for consolidating change logs Batch .Suggested implementationThe patch adds an interface o.a.j.spi.commons.batch.ChangeLog. A ChangeLog is a specialized Batch which keeps a list of Operations. The apply method applies these operations to another batch. There are two implementations of the ChangLog interface in the patch ChangeLogImpl and ConsolidatingChangeLog. ChangeLogImpl implements the default behavior for a ChangeLog. ConsolidatingChangeLog is a specialization of ChangeLogImpl and does some simple consolidation i.e. addNode followed by deleteNode operations cancel each other . Fixed at revision 747347 Applied the patch with minor cosmetic changes
