Repository is not unlocked if version manager init failed and assertions are enabled
The following test case will work as expected except when assertions are enabled java -ea ... Connection conn DriverManager.getConnection          jdbc derby repository version db create true Statement stat conn.createStatement stat.execute create table version bundle id int TransientRepository rep new TransientRepository try     rep.login new SimpleCredentials new char 0 catch Exception e      ignore rep.shutdown stat.execute drop table version bundle new TransientRepository .login new SimpleCredentials new char 0 The reason is the assertion in RepositoryContext.getInternalVersionManager. Because of this assertion the repository lock is not released during the repository shutdown. I removed the assertion in revision 1037668.
