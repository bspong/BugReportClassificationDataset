Path returned by FileSystemBLOBStore.createId is not absolute
Hi I have developed my own FileSystem in which I call FileSystemPathUtil.checkFormat path for every operation on the file system. When the file system is called to store a BLOB value the path I get is always relative resulting in a not an absolute path FileSystemException. The problem has been traced back to org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.util.FileSystemBLOBStore.creatId . I think there should be a    sb.append FileSystem.SEPARATOR CHAR before the for loop. Thanks.Attached simple patch to fix the problem.Please discard the previous patch. It was not run against the latest version of the file. Sorry - fixed as suggested in svn r414175 david thanks for reporting this issue
