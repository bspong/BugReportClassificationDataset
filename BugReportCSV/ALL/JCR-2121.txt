Use java.util.UUID
Replace the use of org.apache.jackrabbit.uuid.UUID with the new java.util.UUID class introduced in Java 5.Hmm after looking at the java.util.UUID class a bit more I don t think we should do it. It contains a number of transient fields that result in quite a bit more memory usage than with our existing UUID class. So resolving as Won t Fix. Instead I think we could look at continuing work on JCR-1232.Reopening as now after JCR-1232 there are only a few non-critical references to the UUID class. Let s use java.util.UUID for those.I have now replaced all UUID references with java.util.UUID or NodeId as appropriate. I also removed the org.apache.jackrabbit.uuid package as it is no longer used.
