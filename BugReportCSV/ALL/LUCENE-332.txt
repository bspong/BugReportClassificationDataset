nightly build javadocs for sandbox
This isn t something i think is crucial but since i ve been on the lucene-users mailing list less then 2 months I ve seen several people post questions asking where they can find documentation on some module available in the sandbox. the answer of course is usually that they should download the source and build the javadocs themselves but since it keeps coming up I figured i d suggest setting up a nightly build of the whole sandbox including the javadocs. if nothing else it will cut down on the number of questions Ð but i think it may also have an added benefit to the size of the user base. In my experience people tend to be more willing to download install something and try it out after they ve read the docs online. I think the plan correct me if I m wrong is to fold the most useful of the sandbox items into the standard Lucene build tree when Lucene s code is moved to a top-level project. They ll still be packaged into separate jar file s . Once this happens javadocs could either be built in a separate tree or perhaps better yet put them in separate javadoc group s http java.sun.com j2se 1.4.2 docs tooldocs windows javadoc.html group For example Nutch uses groups to separate the Core APIs from plugins http www.nutch.org docs api overview-summary.html Yes that s what we had agreed upon I believe. This bug can probably be invalidated 1.9 will be out real-soon-now and the initial changes to include contrib code as seperate groups of the primary javadocs is already done. See also LUCENE-499 Ð a patch to add the javadocs for the remaining contrib modules. This is now fixed. Contrib documentation is part of both the nightly builds and the 1.9 release and hence hosted on the website .
