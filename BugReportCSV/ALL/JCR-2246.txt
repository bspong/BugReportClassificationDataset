Deprecate remove unused FileSystem features such as RandomAccessOutputStream
Currently the FileSystem interface includes a method getRandomAccessOutputStream. It looks like this method and the class RandomAccessOutputStream is no longer used. If this is the case I suggest we remove the method everywhere and deprecate the class.There are other features that seem to be unused such as touch move copy and list. Still needed are listFiles and listFolders so we might as well keep list. But we could remove touch move and copy from the FileSystem interface. What do you think It would simplify implementing a new file system. 1 for removing unused methods and classes. 1 To cleaning up the interface. Dropping the FileSystem interface entirely might be a bit too drastic for 2.0 but I d certaily consider doing that in the 3.0 timeframe.getRandomAccessOutputStream was used for experimental Lucene support which however was abandoned for several reasons. touch move et al were used in very early jackrabbit implementations. AFAIK they re not used anymore. 1 for removing unused legacy code. Using fix version 2.0.0 instead of 2.0-alpha7 as the latter release was already tagged.
