It s not possible to register event listeners that filters on mixin supertypes
The current implementation of blocks in EventFilter does not check if the given EventState has a mixin that is derived from one of the given node types.This patch adds code to check if the given EventState has a mixin that is derived from a node type that should not be blocked.Fixed in revision 464496 I ve changed the patch a bit and moved some code into the EventState class. Thank you for reporting this issue and providing a patch.
