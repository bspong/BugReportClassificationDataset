RFE Make Credentials Serializable
I ve been working on upgrading the HtmlUnit library to use HttpClient 4 and I ve realized that we could eliminate some hackish internal code if Credentials instances were Serializable. I don t really see a downside and this would be a huge convenience for us. The change would involve making the org.apache.http.auth.Credentials interface extend Serializable and having org.apache.http.auth.BasicUserPrincipal and org.apache.http.auth.NTUserPrincipal implement Serializable plus serialVersionUIDs where appropriate I guess .AFAIK classes implementing Serializable must have a non-argument constructor and non-final member variables. This would have to be changed. However I support this request. Or add a way to create serializable versions of Credentials and Headers .As far as I know a class does not have to comply with the Java Bean spec in order to be Serializable. Both HttpHost and HttpVersion are valid Serializable while they do not have a no arg constructor and have final fields. I always wanted to keep persistence aspects out of HttpClient but if there is popular demand for it I can live with making BasicUserPrincipal NTUserPrincipal as well as BasicClientCookie BasicClientCookie2 and BasicCookieStore Serializable. OlegFixed in SVN trunk OlegDo you mind making BasicHeader and BufferedHeader also implement Serializable I very much regret making HttpHost and HttpVersion serializable. In my opinion persistence aspects should be kept out of HttpCore. Why do you want those classes serializable Oleg
