repository is locked by WorkspaceJanitor when another workspace is reindexing
when the searchindex is corrupt or missing it is rebuilt lazily after initialization of a workspace. usually by the first login on that workspace. during this time the workspaceinfo is locked. unfortunately the workspace janitor locks the repository and checks all workspace infos if they can be disposed. in this case no other access to the repository can be performed until the searchindex is initialized which can take some time . T1 - WS1.login - WS initializing Janitor - lock repo - scan - try lock WS1 T2 - WS2.login - must wait for T1 fixed in 410482 please note that there is still a very small possiblity of a synchronization problem during the shutdown perdiod of the repository. if a login on an uninizialied workspace occurss during shutdown a NPE could be thrown.
