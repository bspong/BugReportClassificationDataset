how-to deployment models
how-to with a detailed description of the steps required for each deployment model.I leave the model 3 to a jcr-rmi experienced user.I forgot to specify that it s a tomcat 4.1.x how-to .Thanks for the HOWTO docs Added to Jackrabbit in revision 160887.Changes 1. Note saying it s a tomcat 4.1 how-to 2. Note added to remember not to use two repository instances against the same physical storage. It seems to be a common configuration error. 3. jcr-rmi how-to. I adapted the example from jcr-rmi javadocs to Tomcat 4.1 but maybe a note saying refer to jcr-rmi javadocs would suffice.typo fixed. Use this patch instead of the previous.Thanks very nice work I committed your changes in revision 161082 with some reorganizations and additional docs Tomcat 5.5 instructions by myself.
