 PATCH remove unused variables
Seems I m the only person who has the unused variable warning turned on in Eclipse This patch removes those unused variables and imports for now only in the search package . This doesn t introduce changes in functionality but it should be reviewed anyway there might be cases where the variables should be used but they are not because of a bug. Created an attachment id 11473 remove unused variables and imports Thanks in CVS. Sometimes unused imports are there for javadoc to find an dlink to. This time that doesn t seem to be the case ant javadocs gives no warnings
