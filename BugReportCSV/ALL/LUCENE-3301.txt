add workaround for jre breakiterator bugs
on some inputs the java breakiterator support will internally crash. for example ant test -Dtestcase TestThaiAnalyzer -Dtestmethod testRandomStrings -Dtests.seed -8005471002120855329 -2517344653287596566 -Dtests.multiplier 3 attached is a patch with workarounds Charlie just hit this. Patch looks good to me http bugs.sun.com bugdatabase view bug.do bug id 7104012 Robert do you know why the bug you provided the link does not find anything I just submitted the bug report this morning. I think it takes a while days weeks to become visible... worst bug tracker EVER I think what happens is all bugs are initially internal to Oracle and they need to be opened up to the public. I presume this is so that critical bug reports don t immediately become available for exploits... but I m just guessing. Bulk close after release of 3.5
