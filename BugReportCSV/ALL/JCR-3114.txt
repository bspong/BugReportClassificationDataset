expose PM for versioning manager so that the consistency check can be run from test cases
We need to be able to run the PM consistency checks for the versioning store as well.Actually it is sufficiently exposed by RepositoryImpl.getRepositoryContext .getInternalVersionManager .getPersistenceManager .Implemented with r1183334See also the recently added JackrabbitRepositoryStub.getRepositoryContext method that allows you to get the context of a test repository even from outside the o.a.j.core package. The RepositoryImpl.getRepositoryContext method itself should not be made public to avoid exposing repository internals to normal JCR clients.It already was protected and remains so....
