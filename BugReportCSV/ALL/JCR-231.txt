 jcr-rmi xpath queries don t work when the underlying QueryResult doesn t return the rows nodes size
o.a.j.rmi.server.ServerQueryResult assumes the underlying NodeIterator always return the number of elements but it migth return -1 in some cases 1 AFAIK depending on the jcr impl. When -1 is returned jcr-rmi fails to return the QueryResult. e.g. it fails with the following xpath query 1 http www.day.com maven jsr170 javadocs jcr-1.0 javax jcr RangeIterator.html getSize probably all the classes in o.a.j.rmi.server that instantiate any javax.jcr.RangedIterator implementation from the package o.a.j.rmi.iterator should be reviewed.All uses of RangedIterator.getSize replaced as proposed in revision 293078. Thanks for the suggestion
