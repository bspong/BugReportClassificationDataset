Use an enumeration for QOM operators
The PFD version of QueryObjectModelConstants contains some incorrect constant values that make it unusable as a source of operator constants. Since we are now using Java 5 I propose that instead of adding our own replacement constant strings we implement a type-safe Operator enumeration that contains fixed versions of all the operator constants declared in QueryObjectModelConstants. The PFD version of QueryObjectModelConstants contains some incorrect constant values that make it unusable as a source of operator constants. I ll assume that this is not the only bug we find in the PDF API thus won t we have to fix those parts before releasing a RI and TCK anyway Yes I ve already filed a bug with a patch against the PFD. However to reduce the number of intermediate JCR 2.0 jars we d need I think it makes sense to use some simple workarounds in Jackrabbit that can easily be removed once a fixed version of the JCR 2.0 jar is available. More notably regardless of the PFD issue I think it makes quite a lot of sense to use type-safe enumerations over plain string constants where possible.The enumeration now exists in o.a.j.spi.commons.query.qom.Operator.
