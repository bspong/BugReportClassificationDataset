InternalValue refactoring
Now that we have use the value factory from spi-commons the InternalValue code should be simplified.Obvious simplifications would include - InternalValue.getLength instead of InternValue.getBLOBFileValue .getLength - InternalValue.discard instead of InternalValue.getBLOBFileValue .discard Furthermore i got the impression that in most cases instances of InternalValue could be reduced to the interface. The most frequent reason why the functionality exposed by the interface isn t sufficient is InternalValue.getUUID used to build a new NodeId reference tracking accessing nodes by uuid etc... . This is related to the discussion in JCR-1232. Committed in revision 784013 and revision 784058 trunk Thomas is there anything else you want to do for 2.0 I guess we could further refactor the InternalValue but we can also do that after 2.0. WDYT Sure there is no immediate need to refactor more. Can we keep it open or do we need to close it and open another for 2.1 I changed the Fix Version to 2.1.Postponing to beyond 2.1.0Or actually... since there doesn t seem to be anything immediate to be changed here it s best to resolve this as fixed and follow up with other issues if or when the need arises.
