Javadocs clean-up
Before Httpclient can be released Javadocs need to be updated and proof-readI just finished brushing up javadocs in HttpMethod changes applied to 2.0 branch HEAD . Awful work. But I have to practice what I preach. HttpMethodBase is next on my list. OlegJust finished cleaning up HttpMethodBase. Changes applied to 2.0 breanch HEAD. What a terrible way to spend the weekend. OlegJavadocs clean-up in org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods. Method classes comitted to branch 2.0 and HEAD. OlegI m going to do a bit of cleanup work on Javadoc for HttpMethod HostConfiguration Header and maybe a couple of others.I only managed to do some cleanup HttpMethod and a little bit on HttpMethodBase and HeaderGroup. It was a lot more work than I thought and it s time for bed. I tried to specify the behavior of the functions more precisely than before using the HttpMethodBase implementation as a guide to what the functions do. Halfway through I started to wonder if this was a good idea because there are some functions where the current behavior is fairly strange and I m not sure if we want to codify it. Please let me know what you think. My opinion is that we should be precise about what the methods do even if it s weird because clients of the API need to know. It can always be cleaned up in 3.0. Many of the methods interact in strange ways that I didn t know about previously and side-effects abound. For example HttpMethodBase.getResponseBodyAsStream only works if a the body has not yet been read or b the body was previously retrieved via a call to getResponseBody or getResponseBodyAsString . Except that if getResponseBodyAsStream has been called previously and releaseConnection has not yet been called it returns the same stream as the last time. One more oddity the generated documentation for HttpMethodBase looks odd in Mozilla 1.4 on Windows XP the font looks larger and maybe different. It s fine in IE. Could someone try this too so I know if it s just my system I ll attach the changes as a patch. I ll try to do some more tomorrow.Created an attachment id 7737 Cleanup of HttpMethod Javadoc Hi Laura These look like good changes to me. I will apply them tonight. MikeApplied to 2.0 and HEAD. MikeCreated an attachment id 7814 Clean up of the NTLM related javadocs. I ve attached the initial draft of the clean up for the NTLM docs. There will be a couple more changes in regards to my recent post to the dev list notably whether or not the class should be made package private or not and on the registering of the JCE.Looks good Adrian.NTLM javadoc update committed to 2.0 and HEAD.Created an attachment id 7930 HostConfiguration Javadoc cleanup A few more minor Javadoc changes. Please take a look and let me know. MikeThe patch looks good to me. OlegPatch applied.Created an attachment id 8211 HttpState Javadoc cleanup My first shot at cleaning up HttpState class javadocs. Let me know what you think. OlegCreated an attachment id 8228 HttpClient Javadoc cleanup Hi Oleg A few comments about the HttpState changes Ê- There is an extra s in the docs for credMap link Credentials credentials s Ê- There is a missing c in the docs for prodxyCred link Credentials proxy redentials Ê- I suggest rewording addCookies Cookie to something like Adds an link Cookie HTTP cookie replacing any existing equivalent cookies. If the given cookie has already expired it will not be added but existing values will still be removed. Ê- I also suggest rewording addCookies Cookie to something like Adds an array of link Cookie HTTP cookies . Cookies are added individually and in the given array order. MikeCreated an attachment id 8229 HttpState Javadoc cleanup take 2 Hi Mike I suggest that we forgo the standard patch approval procedure for javadocs patches. I tend to see the communication overhead of it as excessive and unnecessary in this particular case. I think it would do no harm if javadoc corrections were applied to the CVS directly as long as changes are non- functional. Any OlegI agree. Patch review for Javadocs is a little much. Let s go ahead and remove the formality. I suggest we still post something to the mailing list regarding the changes. Mike I suggest we still post something to the mailing list regarding the changes. That goes without saying. Oleg Javadoc changes for HttpState and Httpclient applied to both HEAD and 2.0 branch. Corrections improvements are welcome. OlegMike I just committed the revised Javadoc of the Header Cookie and HttpConnection classes. Please have a look and make corrections you deem necessary. Folks As far as I am concerned that completes my mission. The documentation for all the essential classes should be up-to-date factually correct and consistent. I also would like to believe that the Javadoc are now reasonably complete as well. What I am unable to do is to ensure that Javadocs are written in readable grammatically correct English. Unless you want the release version of HttpClient documentation to carry a thick Russian accent please someone who speaks English natively proof-read the documentation at least of the most essential classes. That would be really appreciated. OlegThey look good to me. Mike
