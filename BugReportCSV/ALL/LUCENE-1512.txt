Incorporate GeoHash in contrib spatial
Based on comments from Yonik and Ryan in SOLR-773 GeoHash provides the ability to store latitude longitude values in a single field consistent hash field. Which elements the need to maintain 2 field caches for latitude longitude fields reducing the size of an index and the amount of memory needed for a spatial search. spatial-lucene GeoHash implementation based on http en.wikipedia.org wiki Geohash removable dependency on refactoring in LUCENE-1504 removable dependency on refactoring in LUCENE-1504 This is awesome. thanks patrick Any chance you could make a new patch without SerialChainFilter moved to search Should we make a new package for geohash based things org.apache.lucene.spatial.geohash GeoHashUtils GeoHashDistanceFilter Also the spacing for GeoHashUtils should be 2 spaces rather then 4. Made necessary changes Formatting fixed Removed dependency on LUCENE-1504 Moved GeoHash elements into o.a.l.spatial.geohash Thanks patrick I just committed this the only change is that I used StringBuilder rather then StringBuffer. The precision is hard coded to 12 Ð perhaps we could make that a variable Is this isssue still relevant seems like it has been committted
