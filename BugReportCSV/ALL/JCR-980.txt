Single quote in contains function is not parsed correctly
If there is a single quote in the contains statement the parser will throw an exception. Example element nt resource jcr contains . it s fun The LuceneQueryBuilder replaces the single quote with a double quote and hence the lucene fulltext query parser fails because there is a missing closing double quote. Not sure why this is done in the code maybe this is a left over from an early JSR 170 draft.Fixed in revision 550412Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 552542.
