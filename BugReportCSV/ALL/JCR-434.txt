ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in NodeTypeDefDiff
It appears that the code for building diffs in child node definitions loops incorrectly opening the possibility for an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception. The offending portion is in the buildChildNodeDefDiffs method NodeDef cnda2 newDef.getChildNodeDefs HashMap defs2 new HashMap for int i 0 i cnda1.length i     defs2.put cnda2 i .getId cnda2 i It seems like simply changing the length check to be cnda2 as it is in buildPropDefsDiff would suffice.fixed in svn r407242 thanks michael Merged for 1.0.1 in revision 409617.
