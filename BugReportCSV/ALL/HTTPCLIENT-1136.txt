BasicClientConnectionManager.releaseConnection accesses poolEntry using non-standard lock
According to the annotation poolEntry is GuardedBy this . However in at least one place it is accessed without holding a lock on this BasicClientConnectionManager.releaseConnection synchronizes on managedConn and then accesses poolEntry without synchronising on this. Synch. only works if all parties use the same lock. Fixed in SVN trunk. Oleg
