Lucene Scorer implementations should handle the advance to NO MORE DOCS optimisation better
This is from the lucene Scorer actually DocIdSetIterator api NOTE this method may be called with NO MORE DOCS for efficiency by some Scorers. If your implementation cannot efficiently determine that it should exhaust it is recommended that you check for that value in each call to this method. None of the scorer implementations does that currently. Except for ChildAxisScorer thanks to JCR-3082. This is a worthwhile effort which can save us from bugs JCR-3082 but also leverage some performance optimisation hints from the lucene api.attached patch to update all scorers. feedback Maybe it would make sense to try to reduce all this code duplication but that s it from my side - fixed in revision 1181086
