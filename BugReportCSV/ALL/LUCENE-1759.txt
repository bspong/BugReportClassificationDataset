Implement TokenStream.end in contrib TokenStreams
See LUCENE-1448. Mike s patch there already contains the necessary fixes. I ll attach a patch here as soon as LUCENE-1460 is committed. First we need to update contrib to the new TokenStream API. Now that LUCENE-1460 is committed I can create a patch here soon. I converted Mike s patch from LUCENE-1448 to use the new end method. All tests pass. I will commit this shortly. Committed revision 799968. This is under new features in changes but wasn t this issue a bug fix Do you mean the entry for LUCENE-1448 I added that as new feature because the end method is new and can be used to perform any end-of-stream operations. In this particular case it s used to fix the offset bug. Hmm maybe I should have made two entries... feel free to move it if you think it doesn t belong there. In this particular case it s used to fix the offset bug. Hmm maybe I should have made two entries... 1. Its not that I feel it doesn t belong there I just want people reading changes to know that bug is fixed - its bitten a couple people in the past multifields highlighter . Koji has been waiting patiently for the fix for some time for one Its not a big deal for sure but I think we should just put it twice - I can copy it to the bug section as well. I ve seen an issue make 3 sections so 2 should be no problem Apologize for being in the wrong issue again by the way - finding myself in the wrong place a lot lately.
