need a way to set time out when using HttpClient and HttpMultiClient
When using class HttpClient or HttpMultiClient there is no way to set the time out value. Because the setTimeout method is in HttpConnection and HttpClient or HttpMultiClient doesn t expose the HttpConnection object. One option is to add a method setTimeout in HttpClient and HttpMultiClient. Another option is to add such a method in HttpMethod.This is very very strange. The nightly builds offer me a method to set timeout on the HttpConnection object however the official download doesn t have this functionality. It s exactly this functionality I m looking for so a quick fix would be highly appreciated. Q. How safe is it to use the nightly build instead of the official download The official download 2.0 alpha 1 is pretty old and there have been some significant changes since then. The nightly builds are fairly stable but there are still some hotspots that are still undergoing some change. Specifically the HttpMultiClient related stuff. Most of the changes in this area to complete missing functionality but there may be some changes to the API prior to the final release.Fixed in nightly builds Jan when you say nightly builds offer me a method to set timeout on the HttpConnection object do you mean HttpConnection.setSoTimeout But how to get hold of the HttpConnection from my HttpClient The connection field is private. Should I subclass HttpClient and create a getClient method I m tempered to re-open this bug but since I m a recent HttpClient user I remain calm... Please also note the related HTTPCLIENT-1. Sorry for the spam but I d like to correct myself    Should I subclass HttpClient and create a getConnection method                                                   Nah... cannot subclass HttpClient since connection is declared as private why not protected Rather I copied HttpClient and added this method void setTimeout int ms   if connection null        return      try        connection.setSoTimeout ms      catch SocketException ex ex.printStackTrace
