Move repository home directory into target directory
Currently the spi test client uses the repository home directory from the jackrabbit-core module. Instead it should use its own repository home preferably in the target directory which can be reset using the maven clean goal.The repository home directory is now in client target repo-home. Fixed in revision 555238
