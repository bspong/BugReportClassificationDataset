 PATCH Field.toString could be more helpful
org.apache.lucene.document.Field.toString defaults to using Object.toString for some sensible fields. e.g. isStored isIndexed isTokenized fields. This makes debugging slightly more difficult than is really needed. Please find pasted below possible alternative Prints a Field for human consumption. public final String toString StringBuffer result new StringBuffer if isStored if isIndexed if isTokenized result.append Text else result.append Keyword else XXX warn on tokenized not indexed result.append Unindexed else if isIndexed if isTokenized result.append Unstored else result.append UnstoredUntokenized else result.append Nonsense UnstoredUnindexed result.append result.append name result.append if readerValue null result.append readerValue.toString else result.append stringValue result.append return result.toString NB Im working against CVS HEAD Doh might want to limit maximum size of stringValue that would get displayed without being truncated. I agree that the output should be improved. Also termVector is currently missing. I attach a patch that moves away from the Text UnStored Keyword stuff etc and explicitly prints indexed stored tokenized termVector. Created an attachment id 12078 patch to improve toString I just committed my patch. The information given by toString is now more verbose and explicit like indexed tokenized .
