TestAddIndexes fails norms file not found 
ant test-core -Dtestcase TestAddIndexes -Dtestmethod testAddIndexesWithRollback -Dtests.seed 2f55291b308dc34b -4d72bfad34f3f357 4bc5ec894269c041 -Dargs -Dfile.encoding UTF-8 -Dtests.iter 100 fails about 4 or 5 times out of 100. here s the patch. unfortunately we still need to impl lucene40codec s files like the other codecs SimpleText Lucene3x . In this situation all documents with that field are actually merged away or whatever so there are no norms. i think its a much larger issue the TODO comment was existing more than just norms. The problem is really about cleaning out fieldinfos . Committed patch. I don t like it any more than you guys do and thats why I put the comment in all the codecs in the first place
