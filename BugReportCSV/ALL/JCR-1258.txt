Add path encoding to ISO9075
The utility class ISO9075 only allows you to encode and decode names. It should also have methods that allow you to pass a path. This is useful when a XPath query is created with a path constraint based on e.g. a Node.getPath .This java class does the encoding and it works with paths. It s not thorougly tested but converted from some stable javascript code doing the same. BTW the name is misleading this class does not do any decoding yet - Replaced the helper class with a new one that has a better name some more javadoc and no longer includes stuff that does not belong there.Let s just implement what s currently required.Added method encodePath String path . svn revision 604166
