Add anchors to documentation sections
In all docs sections are missing a name anchors. I see that the xdocs stylesheet in the repository is supposed to generate them yet the site is missing them at this moment. See https svn.apache.org repos asf jakarta site xdocs stylesheets site.xsl template match section We happily accept patches. OlegI looked at the stylesheet above it already had the code to generate anchors. What do you mean we happily accept pathces . Is that the wrong stylesheet Which stylesheet generates the site 1 Pardon my ignorance but I do not quite understand why this is a problem. 2 As far as open-source projects are concerned the best way to fix a problem is by fixing it yourself and submitting a patch OlegThe site is generated using the Maven Site Plugin. This does not use the site.xsl file you mention. The HttpComponents site uses the APT format for documentation source files. AFAICT anchors need to be defined using the format anchor They are not automatically generated from the section headings. The APT source files are in SVN if you want to look e.g. http svn.apache.org repos asf httpcomponents httpclient trunk src site aptTo Oleg - I am happy to produce a patch just trying to figure out where the change should be made To Sebb - thanks for the helpful information. According to http maven.apache.org doxia references doxia-apt.html Anchors for section titles I only need to wrap all section titles in the apt files with curly braces to make them into anchors. I will submit a patch for that.For ease of navigation and indexing made most sections and subsections generate their anchors. Added anchors to certain lists.Patch checked in. Many thanks Nicholas Oleg
