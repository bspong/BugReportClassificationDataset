TextFilter implementations in a new project under contrib
ÊAFAIK the TextFilters sent by J‡n Hala a were not added yet. If that s the case I think we can create a project under contrib with all the implementations in order to avoid adding new dependencies to the core distribution.I mavenized the project and added a MsPowerPoint impl.Added in revision 208978closing resolved issue
