Make FieldSortedHitQueue public
Currently those who utilize the advanced search API cannot sort results using the handy FieldSortedHitQueue. I suggest making this class public to facilitate this use as I can t think of a reason not to. Created an attachment id 16383 Patch to make FieldSortedHitQueue public Patch created against current trunk as of today. I d like to see this patch applied. Right now I have to work around this by having my own org.apache.lucene.search package with the following class public class PublicFieldSortedHitQueue extends FieldSortedHitQueue public PublicFieldSortedHitQueue IndexReader reader SortField fields int size throws IOException super reader fields size Does anyone have a good reason not to make FieldSortedHitQueue public Are there changes to the class that people would like to see before it is made public I ve had to work around this issue myself so I m inclined to commit. 1 I d lose the Now public to facilitate sorting with the expert query API comment. We shouldn t give the history of the code in the javadoc. I committed this. Thanks
