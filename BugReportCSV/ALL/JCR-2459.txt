Improved error reporting from JcrUtils.getRepository
The service provider mechanism and the null return value used by the RepositoryFactory API makes it a bit difficult to troubleshoot cases where a repository can not be accessed. It would be helpful if the JcrUtils.getRepository methods reported as accurate failure information as possible in case the requested repository is not found.Done in revision 897858.URISyntaxException is swallowed. code java     public static Repository getRepository Map String String parameters             throws RepositoryException ..     try     ...      catch URISyntaxException e      Ignore invalid URIs      code java This catch block was probably left empty by some intention. However if URI is incorrect no message indicating this reason will be in log.
