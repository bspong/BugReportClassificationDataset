Thread safety and visibility Improvements
AbstractAuthenticationHandler.DEFAULT SCHEME PRIORITY is not protected against external changes. Although the field is private subclasses can obtain a reference to it and so may be able to change it. Consider making the list read-only or returning a copy instead.org.apache.http.impl.client.RoutedRequest has two final protected fields. However both of these are also accessible via public get methods so the fields could be made private. The class does not currently have any subclasses.Made AbstractAuthenticationHandler.DEFAULT SCHEME PRIORITY a non-modifiable list This allowed 3 classes to become immutable commit -m Make AbstractAuthenticationHandler immutable by changing the List to unmodifiable     Sending D eclipseworkspaces main httpcomponents-client httpclient src main java org apache http impl client AbstractAuthenticationHandler.java     Sending D eclipseworkspaces main httpcomponents-client httpclient src main java org apache http impl client DefaultProxyAuthenticationHandler.java     Sending D eclipseworkspaces main httpcomponents-client httpclient src main java org apache http impl client DefaultTargetAuthenticationHandler.java     Transmitting file data ...     Committed revision 755783.
