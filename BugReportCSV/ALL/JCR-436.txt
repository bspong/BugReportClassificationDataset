InvalidQueryException thrown for a SQL query using WHERE CONTAINS . someword 
The following SQL query SELECT FROM es document WHERE CONTAINS . software throws an InvalidQueryException exception. javax.jcr.query.InvalidQueryException Encountered . at line 1 column 42. Was expecting one of      BY ...      IN ...      OR ...      IS ...      AND ...      LIKE ...      NULL ...      FROM ...      ORDER ...      WHERE ...      SELECT ...      BETWEEN ...      ...      REGULAR IDENTIFIER ...      DELIMITED IDENTIFIER ...      This syntax seems correct according to the latest jcr spec 1.0.1 . Using an asterisk instead of a dot . as the first parameter of CONTAINS works fine.This is a leftover from an unreleased version of the JCR spec. Unfortunately the relevant test case is also broken. Both is now fixed. Jackrabbit still allows to use the in the contains function to remain somewhat backward compatible with previously released jackrabbit versions even though this is not correct according to the spec. Fixed in svn 410461
