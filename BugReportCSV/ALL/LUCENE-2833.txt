upgrade contrib ant s tidy.jar
contrib ant uses a Tidy.jar that also includes classes in org.w3c.dom org.xml.sax etc. This is no problem if you are an ant user but if you are an IDE user you need to carefully configure the order of your classpath or things will not compile as these will override the ones in the Solr libs for example. The solution is to upgrade the tidy.jar to the newest one that only includes org.w3c.tidy and doesn t cause these problems. Here s a patch i updated to the latest tidy.jar from their sourceforge site. I checked the license is still BSD but i also copied their LICENSE.txt to our lib folder as JTIDY-LICENSE.txt since this was missing before. tests pass with the new jar file. here s the jar file for convenience.
