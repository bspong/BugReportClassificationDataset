Make PKIndexSplitter and MultiPassIndexSplitter work per segment
Spinoff from LUCENE-3624 DocValuesw merger throws exception on IW.addIndexes SlowMultiReaderWrapper as string-index like docvalues cannot provide asSortedSource. This only affects Lucene 4.0 as 3.x has no DocValues. The PKIndexSplitter per-segment variant could be backported to 3.x but the MultiPassIndexSplitter working on absolute doc-Ids cannot handle that as AtomicReaderContext containing the docBase is not available in 3.x. Correction It could work but it does not rectify the complexity. this issue is not broken by LUCENE-3624. Prior to LUCENE-3624 you just got a NullPointerException instead of a UnsupportedOperationException Instead of complaining help to fix it. There was no better relation for it. I m not complaining but you marked my issue as breaking this functionality thats insanity Lets revisit the situation As of yesterday if you used one of these tools all docvalues fields were silently dropped and merge succeeded data loss I fixed this in LUCENE-3623 but in testing exposed the fact that with the data loss fixed if you had a sortedsource you would get a non-obvious NullPointerException deep in the docvalues codec stack. Because of this LUCENE-3624 changes the NullPointerException to UnsupportedOperationException so that its clear that this isn t working and why. Change the relations if you like and find better ones I am out of this issue now - unassigned myself and I will unassign from other Lucene issues now because of this stupidness. Goodbye. Shouldn t we just fix MultiDV to handle SortedSource Ie merge the terms assign ords across all subs just like FieldCache does using MultiTermsEnum if you ask for DocTermsIndex on a SlowMRWrapper. It s OK for this op to be costly Ð SlowMRReader advertises this... Mike I agree with that 1 Still we might think about making the index splitter work per segment. The PKIndexSpliter already works with a standard Lucene Filter by default TermRangeFilter so it could handle the segmentreaders directly. Patch that makes PKIndexSplitter and MultiPassIndexSplitter work per segment. It also fixes the stupid MultiReader initialize method which prevents finalness of fields. It also makes MultiReader.starts readerIndex public to get the doc bases. New patch for the changes in trunk. It is ready to commit. This can be backported to 3.6 Committed trunk revision 1212894 Committed 3.x revision 1212906
