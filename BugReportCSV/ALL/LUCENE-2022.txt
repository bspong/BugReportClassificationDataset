remove contrib deprecations
there aren t too many deprecations in contrib to remove for 3.0 but we should get rid of them. patch for analysis and wikipedia the ones i feel comfortable about i think this analysis stuff is obvious. I will commit it soon. if anyone wants to jump in and look at the other deprecations contrib misc queries etc please do Committed revision 831425 LUCENE 2022 analysis wikipedia.patch . patch to remove the rest of the 2.9 deprecations. any 3.0 deprecations except the ones from javacc generated code are marked with will be removed in 4.0 as well for now. also add a will be removed in 4.0 to the deprecated DistanceApproximation in spatial For also add a will be removed in 4.0 to the deprecated DistanceApproximation in spatial I think hope spatial is marked as experimental Ð there should be no commitment to hang on to APIs until 4.0... who knows how far off that is When spatial gets some attention there should be more flexibility to design things as best they can be. Ryan do you think it is best to just remove this class instead attached is a patch that changes the javadocs for the spatial class to will be removed in a future release since it is experimental. if no one objects i would like to resolve this issue soon it would be nice if someone could at least give a quick review make me feel more comfortable btw i found the javadocs typo of deprecated Use link TextFragment CharSequence int int instead. i ll correct this i think everything else is ok though. 1 I am currently fixing core s javadocs LUCENE-1980 . Can you check contrib Uwe I will check comment under your LUCENE-1980 issue there shouldn t be too many issues not much was deprecated in contrib. I will commit this one soon. I will commit this one soon. 1 looks good to me Committed revision 834707.
