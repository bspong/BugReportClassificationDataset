Command line access to remote repositories
A few years ago Edgar Poce implemented a nice command line JCR access tool called jcr-commands. We haven t really been using it much and the code is currently parked in sandbox inactive. I d like to resurrect this codebase and integrate it to jackrabbit-standalone to implement command line access to remote repositories. The idea would be to have an easy-to-use tool for simple testing and administration tasks. The code has been integrated to trunk and the 2.1 branch. There s a number of things that could be improved but since everything basically works I m resolving this as fixed and leaving any additional improvements to followup issues.
