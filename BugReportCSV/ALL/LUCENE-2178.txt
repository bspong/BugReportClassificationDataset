Benchmark contrib should allow multiple locations in ext.classpath
When ant run-task is invoked with the -Dbenchmark.ext.classpath ... option only a single location may be specified. If a classpath with more than one location is specified none of the locations is put on the classpath for the invoked JVM. Trivial patch to fix works with single or multiple locations Index contrib benchmark build.xml contrib benchmark build.xml revision 892657 contrib benchmark build.xml working copy -114 7 114 7 path id run.classpath path refid classpath pathelement location build.dir classes java - pathelement location benchmark.ext.classpath pathelement path benchmark.ext.classpath path property name task.alg location conf micro-standard.alg Looks good Ð I ll commit. Thanks Steven
