IndexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize ignores the compound file setting of the destination index
IndexWriter.addIndexesNoOptimize Directory ignores the compound file setting of the destination index. It is using the compound file flags of segments in the source indexes. This sometimes causes undesired increase of the number of files in the destination index when non-compound file indexes are added until merge kicks in. 2.4.0 branch IndexWriter.java method resolveExternalSegments line 3072 final MergePolicy.OneMerge newMerge new MergePolicy.OneMerge segmentInfos.range i 1 i info.getUseCompoundFile info.getUseCompoundFile seems to be wrong this is on the src index not the target index should be getUseCompoundFile instead. Good catch That s in the resolveExternalSegments method which simply copies over one for one any segments from the source index that didn t need merging according to the merge policy. Were there any other places in addIndexesNoOptimize where we don t preserve CFS properly Yasuhiro John could you work up a unit test showing the problem w patch showing that the test passes I added the test case committed. Thanks Yasuhiro
