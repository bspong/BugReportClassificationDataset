FastVectorHighlighter adds a multi value separator space to the end of the highlighted text
The FVH adds an additional the multi value separator to the end of the highlighted text. Fix. Updated patch. As I think this fix changes runtime behavior I added an entry to CHANGES.txt. I changed Field.isTokenized to Field.fieldType .tokenized as well because it cannot be compiled in trunk. trunk Committed revision 1232470. 3x Committed revision 1232473. Thanks Shay
