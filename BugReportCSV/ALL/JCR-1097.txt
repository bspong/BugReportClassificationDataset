Move the XASession interface to jackrabbit-api
As discussed in JCR-953 it would probably make sense to move the org.apache.jackrabbit.core.XASession from jackrabbit-core to jackrabbit-api as org.apache.jackrabbit.api.XASession.Attached a proposed patch XASession.patch . I m not sure about all the implications of this move so please review. The previous o.a.j.core.XASession interface would remain as a deprecated interface that simply extends o.a.j.api.XASession. The existing XASessionImpl would also for now keep implementing the deprectated o.a.j.core.XASession interface instead of the new jackrabbit-api version to avoid backwards compatibility issues.Moved the XASession interface to jackrabbit-api in revision 573705.
