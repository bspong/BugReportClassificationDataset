Remove the unneeded cqfs dependencies
There s still unneeded dependencies to the cqfs libraries in jcr-server webapp and jca.Removed the extra dependencies in revision 389904. Merged to 1.0 in revision 389906.Removed the cqfs dependencies also from jca in revision 389922. Merged to 1.0 in revision 389923.Configuration still references CQFS filesystem in repository.xml. I suggest we configure the derby persistence manager and add the derby library as dependency.Resolved in revision 391024 by replacing the CQFileSystem configuration with LocalFileSystem. I didn t configure the Derby file system or persistence manager to avoid extra changes.
