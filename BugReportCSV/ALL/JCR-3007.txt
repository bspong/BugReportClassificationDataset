setProperty access control evaluation does not properly cope with XA transactions
This is another instance of the problems with ACL evaluation within transactions described in https issues.apache.org jira browse JCR-2999. In this case PropertyImpl getParent called from PropertyImpl checkSetValue is trying to check read permissions of the yet uncommited parent and thus fails with an ItemNotFound exception. The problem is reproducible with the following test public void testTransaction throws Exception          make sure testUser has all privileges         Privilege privileges privilegesFromName Privilege.JCR ALL         givePrivileges path privileges getRestrictions superuser path          create new node and lock it         Session s getTestSession         UserTransaction utx new UserTransactionImpl s         utx.begin          add node and save it         Node n s.getNode childNPath         if n.hasNode nodeName1             Node c n.getNode nodeName1             c.remove             s.save                   create node and save         Node n2 n.addNode nodeName1         s.save - node is NEW - no failure          set a property on a child node of an uncommited parent         n2.setProperty propertyName1 testSetProperty         s.save - fail because PropertyImpl getParent called from PropertyImpl checkSetValue                         was checking read permission on the not yet commited parent          commit         utx.commit      Proposed patch addressing the issue illustrated by the test above. Please review. 1 patch looks goodcommitted patch in svn r1141141 thanks Merged into 2.2 branch in revision 1141745
