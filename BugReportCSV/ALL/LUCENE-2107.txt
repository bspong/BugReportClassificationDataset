Add contrib fast-vector-highlighter to Maven central repo
I m not at all familiar with the Lucene build deployment process but it would be very nice if releases of the fast vector highlighter were pushed to the maven central repository as is done with other contrib modules. Issue filed at the request of Grant Ingersoll. This patch adds a pom template to fast-vector-highlighter. We should also think about pushing the artifact for 3.0 and 2.9. Has anyone done this before Grant I will commit this soon if nobody objects commited in revision 887339. I will leave this issue open as we need to port this to 3.0 2.9. I can not commit to branches can anyone else do that please. I will merge the 2 branches. We should now discuss if I should add the pom.xml to the 3.0 release checkout and rebuild this one artifact for evtually put it into the repo. We have a vote open for this topic - once the vote is over I publish the result here and close the issue. The vote passed - the artifacts have been pushed to the repo. and should be available soon. The missing maven artifacts for the fast-vector-highlighter contrib of Lucene Java in version 2.9.1 and 3.0.0 are now available at http repo1.maven.org maven2 org apache lucene http repo2.maven.org maven2 org apache lucene
