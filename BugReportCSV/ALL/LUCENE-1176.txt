TermVectors corruption case when autoCommit false
I took Yonik s awesome test case TestStressIndexing2 and extended it to also compare term vectors and it s failing. I still need to track down why but it seems likely a separate issue. Attached patch that extends TestStressIndexing2 to also check term vectors. Attached patch fixes the corruption case. It happens if you first add docs with no term-vector enabled fields and then later add at least one doc with term vectors. All tests pass. I will commit shortly backport to 2.3. Backported to 2.3.
