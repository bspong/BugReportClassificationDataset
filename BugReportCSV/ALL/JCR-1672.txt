Adding Event interface and isLocal 
when a repository cluster is used it seems that a common problem many people have is to detect if an observation event is send because of changes on the local instance or a remote instance of the cluster. This is especially important if you want to do post processing of data based on observation the post processing should only be done by one instance in the cluster . A current solution is to cast the jcr event object to the EventImpl of jackrabbit core which is obviously not a nice solution So what about adding an event interface to jackrabbit api which extends the jcr event interface and adds the isLocal method i would rather add the isExternal method to the interface. local is already occupied by the listener registration and means that only local-events i.e. this session should be observed.Yes makes sense.This adds the local event listener interface to jackrabbitApplied patch in revision 677261Also affects jackrabbit-core.As discussed in the mailing list it s better to have the isExternal method on an extension of the event interface.New patch adding the ExtendedEvent interface and the isExternal method.Thanks Patch applied in revision 679735. In revision 679741 I renamed the interface to JackrabbitEvent for consistency with the previous JackrabbitSomething naming pattern for Jackrabbit-specific extensions. About the naming of the method IMHO isExternal is still semantically a bit too close the logical opposite to the local flag in listener registration. How about isClusterLocal Also I reverted the original patch revision 677261 the LocalEventListener interface in revision 679750. We can reintroduce the interface once we can leverage the extra information it gives to the observation manager but until that it s better to avoid having two different mechanisms for the same functionality.I m not sure what the best wording might be but I think isExternal is ok - for me the opposite of isLocal would be isRemote IMO isExternal is a good choice since it not entirely tied to a cluster setup. It just specifies that the underlying data was changed but the modification did not go through this repository. theoretically one could modify the values in the DB directly and then send such an event which is of course discouraged - .So I think we can close this bug.Agreed. Resolving as Fixed.
