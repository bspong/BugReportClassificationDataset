SnapshotDeletionPolicy.snapshot throws NPE if no commits happened
SDP throws NPE if no commits occurred and snapshot was called. I will replace it w throwing IllegalStateException. I ll also move TestSDP from o.a.l to o.a.l index. I ll post a patch soon Patch fixes SDP adds relevant test to TestSDP and move TestSDP to o.a.l.index. To apply the patch you first need to run svn mv lucene src test org apache lucene TestSnapshotDeletionPolicy.java lucene src test org apache lucene index TestSnapshotDeletionPolicy.java I plan to commit this shortly. Committed revision 935522. Backport to 3.1 Committed revision 941427. backport
