Index migration fails for property names that are prefixes of others
The automatic index migration JCR-1363 introduced in Jackrabbit version 1.5.0 replaces the separator char for named term text in PROPERTIES field. Util 1.4.x uFFFF was used and after migration is used. This changes the overall order of PROPERTIES terms and leads to assertion failures. See attached test.Fixed in revision 881299Please find attached a patch for JackRabbit 1.6. This patch includes JCR-2393 and JCR-2410. When upgrading from an older version to 1.6.3 this bug scramble our indexes. Because of the size 5 Gb rebuilding the indexes was no easy option. Maybe you can integrate this patch into the 1.6 branch.
