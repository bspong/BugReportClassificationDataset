allow cache to be configured as a non-shared private cache
Currently the CachingHttpClient only behaves as a shared cache which is a safe and conservative assumption. However in some settings it would be appropriate to be able to configure the CachingHttpClient as a non-shared cache which would make more responses cacheable including responses to requests with Authorization headers responses with Cache-Control private ability to serve stale responses when invalidation fails for Cache-Control proxy-revalidate I have attached a patch to address this issue. Please note that this patch also includes the HttpParams-style configuration patch that was posted for issue 972 https issues.apache.org jira browse HTTPCLIENT-972 If you need me to rebuild this because you have already applied said patch for issue 972 I m happy to do so . Major changes in this patch are to extract an AbstractProtocolTest superclass from TestProtocolRequirements so that we can inherit from this for a new test class TestProtocolAllowedBehavior i.e. things where the HTTP 1.1 spec says we MAY do something . All MUST requirements currently under test still pass but now we cache responses for the items mentioned in this issue if we are a non-shared private cache. This patch is contributed to the ASF with the permission of my employer.Sorry just found a minor problem with my patch will resubmit shortly. This is a corrected patch that makes AbstractProtocolTest an abstract class maven was trying to run it as a test case . That s the only difference between this patch and the previous one. This patch is contributed to the ASF with the permission of my employer. Uploading a version of the patch compatible with the recent resolution of issue 972 i.e. using the CacheConfig bean for configuration of the caching module . This patch is contributed with the permission of my employer. Patch checked in. Oleg
