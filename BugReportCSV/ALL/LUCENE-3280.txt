Add new bit set impl for caching filters
I think OpenBitSet is trying to satisfy too many audiences and it s confusing error-proned as a result. It has int long variants of many methods. Some methods require in-bound access others don t of those others some methods auto-grow the bits some don t. OpenBitSet doesn t always know its numBits. I d like to factor out a more focused bit set impl whose primary target usage is a cached Lucene Filter ie a bit set indexed by docID int not long whose size is known and fixed up front backed by final long and is always accessed in-bounds. Initial patch w some nocommits still but tests pass... I think FastBitSet should still have Expert returns the long storing the bits public long getBits return bits The whole reason I had to create OpenBitSet in the first place was that you couldn t do anything custom fast on a word-for-word basis because the bits were locked away from you. OK I ll add getBits . New patch renaming to FixedBitSet adding test adapted from TestOBS s adding getBits hashCode equals. I think it s ready to commit
