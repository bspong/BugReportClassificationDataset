Error when registering node types on virgin repository
When a node type is registered on a repository that has never been started before an error is written to the log 26.10.2006 10 36 02 ERROR main VirtualNodeTypeStateManager Unable to index new nodetype javax.jcr.ItemNotFoundException VirtualNodeTypeStateManager.java line 159 Steps to reproduce maven test clean cp applications test repository namespaces ns re.properties.install applications test repository namespaces ns re.properties cp applications test repository nodetypes custom nodetypes.xml.install applications test repository nodetypes custom nodetypes.xml Run test case o.a.j.init.NodeTypeData It seems that the workspace initialization creates node states for jcr system and a child node jcr nodeTypes. The latter however is overlayed by a virtual node state provided by the VirtualNodeTypeStateProvider. In case of an initial startup the jcr nodeTypes node is cached on creation and is not overlayed by the virtual twin from the VirtualNodeTypeStateProvider. IMO the jcr nodeTypes node state shouldn t have been created in the first place because it is overlayed anyway. The workspace initialization routine should only create a child node entry in the jcr system node state but no actual child node state for that entry. Opinions Fixed as proposed in svn revision 469123The fix still tries to store the jcr system node state in the regular workspace persistence manager.The jcr system node is now created within the same method as the root node of the workspace SharedItemStateManager.createRootNodeState . In contrast to the previous initialization in RepositoryImpl.initWorkspace the jcr system node is created with just the two child node entries one for jcr versionStorage and one for jcr nodeTypes but the two child node state are not acutally created there because both are virtual states and already exist. Fixed in revision 469480
