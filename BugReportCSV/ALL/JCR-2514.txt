spi2dav Drop Q DefinitionImpl implementations and use spi-commons Q DefinitionBuilder
spi2dav provides separate implementations of the Q Definition interfaces that apart from the construction just duplicate the code present in spi-commons. Instead the Q DefinitionBuilder helpers could be used to generate the definition instances.created a DefinitionUtil that provides static helper methods to build the definitions from the given parameters. the code executed in the constructors of the removed classes has been moved over and adjusted to use Q DefinitionBuilder. roughly tested by running the org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.nodetype.TestAll.suite with the setup provided by jackrabbit-jcr2dav.
