WebDAV pack AbstractWebdavServlet with the jackrabbit-webdav project
suggestion posted by alan cabrera on the dev list Quite a handy servlet. Too bad it s in jackrabbit-server. Would this not be better placed in jackrabbit-webdav I m writing my own server bits under WEBDAV and would prefer not to have JCR Jackrabbit stuff. I realize that this is a fussy preference. unless someone objects or has different preferences i would like to - copy the AbstractWebdavServlet to the jackrabbit-webdav project - package name org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav.server - replace usage of IOUtil.UNDEFINED TIME by a corresponding DavConstant - deprecate the AbstractWebdavServlet present in jcr-server project - adjust servlets present in jackrabbit-webapp to extend from the abstract servlet in    jackrabbit-webdav component.
