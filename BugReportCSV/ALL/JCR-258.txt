Jcr-Server Contrib Remove JDOM dependencies
JDOM has been replace throught the jackrabbit project except the jcr-server contrib. i would like to suggest the following steps 1 consolidate the xml serialization e.g. by defining a common interface .      currently this is not handled consistently throughout the dav-library. 2 improve distinction between objects that are created on the client side     and read from the xml on the server and vice versa. currently the classes     focus on the server-side only. i think this would improve the classes and make it easier to complete the original task that originates from jdom not being backwards compatible between the final release and 0 x-beta versions. 3 replace jdom.       i might be mistaken but i got the impression that in contrast to jdom       the standard w3c-dom is not very comfortable in terms of usage.       currently i m thinking of rather using sax-events in order to write the xml       to the request response body. this would also require that no exhaustive       dom-tree is created in advance e.g. deep PROPFIND but the multistatus       xml is built but when writing the response. so far the following steps are completed - created a common interface for classes that must serialized as xml either on client or on the server side.    thus making the toXml method consistent. - modified the corresponding classes - removed JDOM dependency and replaced by w3c.DOM. in a first step i dropped the idea of using SAX events. - minor improvement regarding 2 . fixed rev. 368683
