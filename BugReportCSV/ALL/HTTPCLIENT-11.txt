null domains break Cookie.java
the domain is assumed to be non-null in a few places in Cookie.java see matches method for exampleIt breaks it in several places. Including the parse method. i m not sure if parse should accept null domains pathsPartial fixes have been implemented for HTTPCLIENT-9. Still to resolve whether parse or createCookieHeader should be allowed to pass null parameters for domain or pathNot a bug.so which methods like parse matches etc should handle nulls We should throw NPE s where appropriate.dIon is this bug still valid Can you describe the NPEs you think we need or provide a unit test that fails I think we can close this one. I did a lot of work in the cookie code to bring in line with the RFC 2109. Methods that receive illegal null values now throw IllegalArgumentException. There s been lots of discussion of this stuff on the commons-dev list and I think everything is resolved. DIon can we close this one Reminder to re-test and close this bug.Patch supplied on mailing list applied.
