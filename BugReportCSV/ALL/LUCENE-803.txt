add svn ignores for eclipse artifacts
Be nice to ignore the files eclipse puts into the project root as we do the .idea file for intellij. The two files are .project .classpath I m gonna lie and say there s a patch available for this because an svn diff patch with propery changes can t be applied with patch anyway. This probably goes for IntelliJ too .iml .iws .ipr and .settings I added the following ignore properties .settings .classpath .project .iml .iws .ipr While we re here can we add prj.el for JDE done
