Stop using BaseException
The o.a.j.BaseException class is deprecated since JCR-1169 and not caught anywhere so there s no need to keep using it.Attached a patch that makes all exceptions that extend BaseException extend Exception instead. Since BaseException is nowhere caught and there is little in common with the descendant exceptions there s no benefit in making them all extend BaseException.i don t agree. what s the benefit of removing BaseException for a related discussion see http www.mail-archive.com jackrabbit-dev incubator.apache.org msg04384.html -1 for removing BaseException unless there s a substantial benefit in doing so.Stefan i don t agree. what s the benefit of removing BaseException On the other hand what s the benefit of having BaseException A while ago the jackrabbit-dev i.a.o reference there still were a few catch clauses for BaseException but now there are no places where BaseException is caught. If it s not used I d rather just get rid of it.this issue does not affect jcr2spi any more. the only usages of BaseException in jcr2spi got removed with revision 641299.Patch applied in revision 732883.Hmm should I have asked before committing this There are old -1s from Stefan and Felix on the mailing list but I figured that they applied to the era when we still had some code that actually did catch BaseExceptions. As Angela mentioned the last such cases were gone in April last year and currently the BaseException class is just dead code. I ll revert the change if someone still feels against this why otherwise I ll assume lazy consensus and leave my commit as is.Looking again at this issue and the related discussion I do not change my mind with respect to simply removing the BaseException. I still think it should have been renamed and the Jackrabbit-internal exception extend from it. What we cold do is make the BaseException extend RepositoryException because that s what it ultimately is - an exception in the Repository Hmm should I have asked before committing this no i m in favor of the changes made. while working on jcr2spi and the nameexceptions i found that after all the BaseExceptions where always caught and re-thrown as RepositoryException. getting rid of that in jcr2spi was an improvement from my point of view. I still think it should have been renamed and the Jackrabbit-internal exception extend from it. Why The class does nothing and is used for nothing. I fail to see the reason why it should exist. angela I see your point this is why I suggested to have the BaseException extend the RepositoryException Jukka The problem is consistent exception handling and understanding what this is all about. In that sense its kind of a categorization of the exceptions. Of course the exceptions previously extending BaseException could just extend RepositoryException. But having them extend Exception is IMHO wrong. Anyway since these are just internal exceptions I don t care too much unless this would lead to method declarations of the form     public type someMethod throws Exception
