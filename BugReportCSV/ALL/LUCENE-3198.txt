Change default Directory impl on 64bit linux to MMap
Consistently in my NRT testing on Fedora 13 Linux 64 bit JVM Oracle 1.6.0 21 I see MMapDir getting better search and merge performance when compared to NIOFSDir. I think we should fix the default. That means we can now enable MMap for all 64 bit platforms Solaris windows Linux - any others except FreeBSD FreeBSD needs to be checked but I assume its also faster there. We can check on lucene.zones maybe. why jump the gun we can just enable it for linux 64-bit. if others like freebsd or macos X are tested then we add those to the list but mmap is a little bit scary to just apply as a blanket default in all cases it should be like the current logic if XYZ OS 64 bit UNMAP SUPPORTED Thats fine I just wanted to talk about the whole issue what to enable when and bring together all possible platform possibilities. In general we should per default only enable SimpleFSDirectory on unknown platforms. Maybe NIO is heavily broken on OS XY Android lol OK I cutover just Linux 64 bit when unmap is available. We can open new issues for other platforms when we have some data that MMap is better... bulk close for 3.3
