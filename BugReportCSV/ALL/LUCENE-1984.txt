DisjunctionMaxQuery - Type safety
DisjunctionMaxQuery code has containers that are not type-safe . The comments indicate type-safety though. Better to express in the API and the internals the explicit type as opposed to type-less containers. Patch attached. Comments backward compatibility concerns welcome. We are converting a lot of these containers to generics currently for Lucene 3.0. In 2.9 we are limited to Java 1.4 Great - Thanks. For the sake of continuity - which branch would this Lucene 3.0 be located in . Having said that - then I believe this can be closed as redundant. 3.0 is currently trunk. 2.9 is a branch. Please leave it open as I am not yet finished with converting to generics. LUCENE-1257 is the main issue for Java 5. Small updates in Patch also implemented Iterable . I also generified the other Disjunction classes. Will commit soon. Thanks Kay Kay Committed revision 825881 Thanks Kay Kay Thanks Uwe. The revised patch looks good as well with better code readability. As a related patch - LUCENE-1985 added to improve readability to convert Iterable statements to for loops introduced in java 5
