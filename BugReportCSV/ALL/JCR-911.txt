Remove sanityCheck from ItemImpl.getSession 
The following code causes an InvalidItemStateException to be thrown for no good reason     Property property ...     property.setValue Value null     property.getSession There are cases I m looking at one right now where it s good to be able to access the session of an Item even if it has already been invalidated. The simple fix is to remove the sanityCheck call from ItemImpl.getSession . I ll do that unless someone has a good reason why the sanity check should be kept.Fixed in revision 537122.Merged to the 1.3 branch in revision 544279.
