Remove benchmark lib xml-apis.jar - JVM 1.5 already contains the required JAXP 1.3 implementation
On LUCENE-2957 Uwe wrote xml-apis.jar is not needed with xerces-2.9 and Java 5 as Java 5 already has these interface classes JAXP 1.3 . Xerces 2.11 needs it because it ships with Java 6 s JAXP release containing STAX Co. not available in Java 5 . On the lucene IRC channel Uwe also wrote since we are on java 5 since 3.0 we have the javax APIs already available in the JVM xerces until 2.9.x only needs JAXP 1.3 so the only thing you need is xercesImpl.jar and serializer.jar serializer.jar is shared between all apache xml projects dont know the exact version number ok you dont need it whan you only parse xml as soon as you want to serialize a dom tree or result of an xsl transformation you need it ... but if we upgrade to latest xerces we need it the xml-apis jar again unless we are on java 6 so the one shipped with xerces 2.11 is the 1.4 one because xerces 2.11 supports Stax Patch against trunk removing xml-apis-2.9.0.jar. lucene and modules compile and successfully pass all tests under Java 1.5. All tests including Solr pass under Java 1.6. I plan on committing shortly. Committed trunk revision 1080258 lucene solr 3 1 revision 1080322 branch 3x revision 1080323 Bulk close for 3.1
