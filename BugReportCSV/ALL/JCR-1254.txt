DatabaseJournal commits twice inside a transaction causing an error with MySQL
When committing a transaction in a clustered setup multiple records may be appended to the DatabaseJournal. After having appended a record commit is called on the connection and auto-commit mode is again enabled. Apart from not being semantically correct committing a connection that is already in auto-commit mode throws an error when using MySQL as backend.Fixed by introducing a lock-level that will reset auto-commit to true only when the final unlock on the journal has been called in revision 600980. Thanks to Dainius Rygelis for reporting.
