Authorizable getProperty and setProperty should deal with relativePath
Authorizable getProperty and setProperty defines the property to be identified by a name. The JCR item based implementation could easily deal with relative paths instead and also retrieve or write properties below child nodes of the rep Authorizable node.Work in progress commit at revision 987435 making the following changes - Authorizable getPropertyNames String relPath NEW - Authorizable hasProperty getPropery setProperty and removeProperty not only deal with names but also with relative paths. - UserManager findAuthorizable changed to deal both with a property name and a relative path. TODO - add more tests for Authorizable property handling - add tests for UserManager findAuthorizable with relative paths
