Exception messages in AuthorizableImpl include full tracebacks at warn level.
In a number of places in AuthourizableImpl there are log.warn with tracebacks. This would be fine however in production with Sling its quite easy to attempt to set a property on the Authorizable and generate the traceback in the logs which soon fill up. We could block all logging from the user manager but that feels wrong. Would it be possible to have the log message at warn level put out a single log line and at debug level put out the full traceback I changed the log level to debug in revision 1000420. The exceptions are in any case thrown to the client application so logging these cases as warnings seems excessive.
