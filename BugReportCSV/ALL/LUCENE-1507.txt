adding EmptyDocIdSet Iterator
Adding convenience classes for EmptyDocIdSet and EmptyDocIdSetIterator I like this it would be good to make memory effective filters where you know that the set is empty from the beginning like a RangeFilter with max min . Instead of creating a empty OpenBitSet one could return this. I would put this class in o.a.l.util. Instead of adding another class couldn t an application simply use a single SortedVIntList of size zero One could cache it and use it for all empty filters if space were really an issue i.e. millions of filters . Cool idea I can do this in TrieRangeQuery when the range is max min. We could simply add a static method somewhere getEmptyDocIdSet to retrieve a single re-used instance of 0-sized SortedVIntList How about that patch It just a static final for usage like this in filters if shortcut condition return DocIdSet.EMPTY DOCIDSET That looks great to me I ll commit in a day or two. Hi Mike I just updated the patch a little bit to supply javadocs for iterator method too. It also contains the first example usage in TrieRangeFilter where a private instance was used until now . This can be committed together with this. Maybe the conventional RangeFilter RangeQuery can be optimized in that way too. New patch looks good thanks Uwe. Committed revision 738895. Thanks John Uwe
