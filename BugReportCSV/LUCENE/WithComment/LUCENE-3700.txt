optionally support naist-jdic for kuromoji
This is an alternative dictionary somewhat larger 25 . we can support it in build.xml so if a user wants to build with it they can the resulting jar file will be 500KB larger attached is a patch. all tests pass if you build with naist-jdic instead. I committed this as is for now if you want to use it you have to change the build.xml and then run ant build-dic and create a custom jar. I noticed this dictionary also has some additional sparsely populated fields but we currently aren t using supporting them... could be nice if they are something useful didn t look
