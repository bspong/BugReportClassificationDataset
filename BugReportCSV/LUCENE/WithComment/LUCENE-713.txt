File Formats Documentation is not correct for Term Vectors
From Samir Abdou on the dev mailing list Hi There is an inconsistency between the files format page from Lucene website and the source code. It concerns the positions and offsets of term vectors. It seems that documentation website is not up to date. According to the file format page offsets and positions are not stored Is that correct Many thanks Samir Indeed in the file formats term vectors section it doesn t talk about the storing of position and offset info. Put in wording to account for offset and position info in the TVF file. Changes have been committed and website updated allow time for synchronization In the current implementation token offsets are not stored as they are provided in the Token. DocumentWriter makes a token s startOffset relative to 1 of the previous Token s endOffset.
