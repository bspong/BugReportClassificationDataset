Range Query works only with lower case terms
I am performing a range query that returns results if the terms are lower case but does not return result when the terms are mixed case. In my collection I have terms alpha beta delta gamma. I am using the StandardAnalyzer for both indexing and searching. The query alpha TO gamma returns all four terms. When I perform the query Alpha TO Gamma no results are returned. It appears the lowerCaseFilter which is a part of the StandardAnalyzer does not work properly on the search terms. I ve used Luke to peek at my collection and the terms are all lower case in the collection. I m fairly new to Lucene so I hope I m not making a common mistake . This has recently been fixed in the development version i.e. the fix will be part of Lucene 1.9. Charles are you using the QueryParser to convert a String into a Query If so that s the problem... when parsing a RangeQuery the endpoints aren t run through the analyzer so they would end up not matching the terms in the index that were analyzed. A workaround for pre-Lucene 1.9 is to subclass QueryParser and override getRangeQuery to lowercase the begin and end terms.
