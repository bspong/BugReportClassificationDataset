Remove Lucene core s FunctionQuery impls
As part of the consolidation of FunctionQuerys we want to remove Lucene core s impls. Included in this work we will make sure that all the functionality provided by the core impls is also provided by the new module. Any tests will be ported across too to increase the test coverage. Patch that deprecates the contents of org.apache.lucene.search.function. I ve gone down this road instead of straight out nuking since they re in core. If people don t feel this necessary I ll happily remove them. The tests for the package do not add anything therefore I haven t moved them. Ports NumericIndexDocValueSource to Queries module. Command for patch svn move lucene src java org apache lucene search function NumericIndexDocValueSource.java modules queries src java org apache lucene queries function valuesource 1 to nuke and remove the duplication and add stuff to migrate.txt like the analyzers saying such and such has moved here. I m confused about the tests... I see more tests in lucene-core under the function package than in the queries module but i didnt look hard... just want to make sure we don t lose anything here. I will re-evaluate the tests and port what I can. New patch which incorporates Robert s suggestions. I have salvaged some of the tests but theres definitely a big TODO in regards to the test coverage. Command coming up. Command for patch svn move lucene src java org apache lucene search function NumericIndexDocValueSource.java modules queries src java org apache lucene queries function valuesource svn move lucene src test org apache lucene search function TestFieldScoreQuery.java modules queries src test org apache lucene queries function svn move lucene src test org apache lucene search function TestOrdValues.java modules queries src test org apache lucene queries function svn force delete lucene src java org apache lucene search function svn force delete lucene src test org apache lucene search function Committed revision 1141747.
