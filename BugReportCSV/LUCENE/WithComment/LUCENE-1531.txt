contrib xml-query-parser BoostingTermQuery support
I m not 100 on this patch. BooleanTermQuery is a part of the spans family but I generally use that class as a replacement for TermQuery. Thus in the DTD I have stated that it can be a part of the root queries as well as a part of a span. However SpanFooQueries xml elements are named SpanFoo rather than SpanFooQuery I have however chosen to call it BoostingTermQuery . It would be possible to set it up so it would be parsed as SpanBoostingTerm when inside of a SpanSomething but I just find that confusing. Previous patch was messed up from cloning SpanTerm.. Any objections to this patch If not I ll pop in the trunk in a few days from now. Looks good to me. The only thing I would be tempted to add is a very brief description of the BoostingTermQuery in the DTD i.e. explaining it s dependency on payloads as a differentiator . I know this duplicates some of the Javadocs but I have developers who refer to the generated XML syntax docs solely as an abstraction away from the underlying Java classes and on first-read it is not obvious that this tag requires at the least special index support. I will re-generate the HTML docs using DTDDoc later once I ve added support for the new Trie-based queries filters Uwe if you re reading this let me know if you think the Trie API has stabilised .
