Rename Field.Index.UN TOKENIZED TOKENIZED NO NORMS
There is confusion about these current Field options and I think we should rename them deprecating the old names in 2.4 2.9 and removing them in 3.0. How about this TOKENIZED ANALYZED UN TOKENIZED NOT ANALYZED NO NORMS NOT ANALYZED NO NORMS Should we also add ANALYZED NO NORMS Spinoff from here http mail-archives.apache.org mod mbox lucene-java-user 200808.mbox 3C48a3076a.2679420a.1c53.ffffa5c4 40mx.google.com 3E Initial patch attached. I intend also fix all places where we use the now-deprecated older names to use the new names on the next rev of this patch but wanted to get the basic change out first in case anyone has violent reactions to the new proposed names Naming is always the hardest part I like the name choices - they read nicely are easy to understand and match what actually happens. OK this patch switches over all uses of the old names to the new ones. I plan to commit in a day or two. Committed revision 694004.
