Search with sort fails when a document has a missing value
Testing on version lucene-1.4-rc2 Call in question IndexSearcher.search Query query Filter filter int nDocs Sort sort Description I m making a call to search with a sort field - in my case I m sorting by date. If any document in the results set Hits has a missing value in the sort field the entire call throws an uncaught exception during the sorting process with no results returned. This is an undesireable result and the prospects for patching this problem outside the search classes are ugly e.g. trying to patch the index itself. This is actually a critical function in my application. Thank you for addressing it. -Dan I cannot reproduce this. Please try if it still happens with Lucene 1.4 final. If it does please paste the complete stacktrace and send a code snippet or better testcase that triggers the bug. My test program passes in version 1.4 final. Changing status to closed.
