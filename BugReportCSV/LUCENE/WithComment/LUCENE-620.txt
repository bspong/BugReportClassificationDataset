GData Server - TestCase Deadlock StorageModifier
Solfed the racecondition deadlock while closing the StorageController. This occured the first time hossman tried to run the test cases. Concurrent Modification Exception while iteration over a collection in a sepereate thread Ð ModifiedEntryFilter replaced list with array. Hossman if you can get to it could you try the testcases again. all If you guys do have time you could run the testcases on different environment that would help to resolve bugs in the test cases and the server. simon patch applies cleanly running many iterations of the tests on my hyperthreaded machine now. I don t think i was able to get the tests to run succesfully more then one time ... in all other cases eitehr 1 failure 2 failures or 1 failure and an exception. ZIP file containing the results is attached. code commited in spite of test failures it doesn t make the problem any worse ... no deadlocks so far
