FuzzyQuery should not be final
I am trying to extend the FuzzyQuery to further filter the TermEnum. I am indexing stem forms and original forms but I only want to match original forms with a fuzzy term otherwise I get to much noise . However FuzzyQuery is a final class and I cannot extend it. As discussed in the mailing list http www.gossamer-threads.com lists lucene java-dev 38756 we want to make the private variables and inner classes protected. I am attaching a patch for FuzzyQuery.java that implements this. I ran all unit tests and they passed without errors. Andreas. Anybody worried about this Seems like a very nominal change. Any reason we would want to inhibit people from extended a query class like FuzzyQuery Making the class non-final is fine. As far as changing members to protected I m not opposed to opening something up a little more so the very expert users don t have to copy the class although that is often an option . In return those expert users shouldn t complain if the internals change Good point on the members. There are public getter methods and the member are set from ctor so the only reason for making them protected is to allow them to be set outside the ctor right Is that really necessary to change them after construction I have a tendency to prefer protected setters over protected fields but there is precedence for this e.g BooleanQuery.minNrShouldMatch so I don t think that part is exceptional. This version of the patch omits making the member variables public. FuzzyQuery is no longer final and some of the nested classes are made protected but the member variables have getters so shouldn t need to be made public. Applied in the trunk thanks. Closing all issues that were resolved for 2.1.
