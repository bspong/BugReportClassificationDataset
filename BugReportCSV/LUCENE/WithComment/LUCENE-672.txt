new merge policy
New merge policy developed in the course of http issues.apache.org jira browse LUCENE-565 http issues.apache.org jira secure attachment 12340475 newMergePolicy.Sept08.patch cloned LUCENE-565 to track this separately. I just committed http issues.apache.org jira secure attachment 12340475 newMergePolicy.Sept08.patch Thanks for the very thorough job on this patch A small fix named KeepDocCount0Segment.Sept15.patch is attached to LUCENE-565 can t attach here . In mergeSegments ... if the doc count of a merged segment is 0 it is not added to the index it should be properly cleaned up . Before LUCENE-672 a merged segment was always added to the index. The use of mergeSegments ... in e.g. addIndexes Directory assumed that behaviour. For code simplicity this fix restores the old behaviour that a merged segment is always added to the index. This does NOT break any of the good properties of the new merge policy. TestIndexWriterMergePolicy is slightly modified to fix a bug and to check that segments are probably cleaned up. The patch passes all the tests. Should lowerBound start off as -1 in maybeMergeSegments if we keep 0 sized segments Should lowerBound start off as -1 in maybeMergeSegments if we keep 0 sized segments Good catch Although the rightmost disk segment cannot be a 0-sized segment right now it could be when NewIndexModifier is in. Shoud I submit a new patch No need to submit a new patch... I made the change and committed it.
