DWPT doesn t see changes to DW infoStream
DW does not push infostream changes to DWPT since DWPT infoStream is final and initialized on DWPTPool initialization at least for initial DWPT we should push changes to infostream to DWPT too We should just make it final everywhere ... simple patch We should just make it final everywhere ... I think you should be able to set it while you are useing IW. its really just like enable debugging though. No need to final or even add to IWC I think I think you should be able to set it while you are useing IW. its really just like enable debugging though. No need to final or even add to IWC I think that said I think changing to a logging framework would be good but hardly feasible I will commit this soon if nobody objects Committed in revision 1100896.
