Broken javadocs- site docs links
See the java-dev mailing list discussion http www.nabble.com Broken-javadocs- 3Esite-docs-links-to20369092.html. When the Lucene Java website transitioned to versioning some of the documentation links from some javadocs were not modified to follow the resources. I found broken links to gettingstarted.html and queryparsersyntax.html. Here is one example to gettingstarted.html the link text is demo http lucene.apache.org java 2 4 0 api org apache lucene document package-summary.html The attached patch converts absolute URLs from javadocs to versioned docs to be relative and modifies the javadocs-all target in build.xml to add a path element named all so that both versions of the javadocs all core contrib and separated core contribs can use the same relative URLs. Adding a path element to the javadocs-all target is necessary because currently the all javadocs have one fewer path element than the separated javadocs. I left as-is one absolute URL in the o.a.l.index.SegmentInfos javadocs to fileformats.html because SegmentInfos is a package-private class and the javadocs targets in build.xml only generate javadocs for public classes. After generating the site with Forrest and then copying over the generated javadocs I found that the MemoryIndex javadoc link to queryparsersyntax.html had two too few go-up-one-level path elements. Also I had forgotten to change the sidebar link to the All javadocs to include the new all path element in src site src documentation content xdocs site.xml. This version fixes these two issues. Committed revision 728262. Thanks Steve Modifications to developer-resources. html xml to point to the new combined All javadocs were missing from the previous patches. This patch corrects the oversight. See http www.nabble.com Hudson-Java-Docs td21650215.html. Committed to site docs. Thanks
