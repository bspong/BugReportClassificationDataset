Remove Deprecated Benchmarking Utilities from contrib benchmark
The old Benchmark utilities in contrib benchmark have been deprecated and should be removed in 2.9 of Lucene. Shouldn t this happen in 3.0 not 2.9 I see no reason why it can t happen w any release. contrib s don t need to have the same back compat and I seriously doubt anyone is using the old way. OK moving back to 2.9. What are the old benchmark utilities What are the old benchmark utilities It s like one class from the pre-Doron Task oriented approach. I believe it s called Benchmark.java and was only able to do a few benchmarking tasks. Oh ok you mean o.a.l.benchmark.Benchmarker AbstractBenchmarker and BenchmarkOptions and retain o.a.l.benchmark.byTask.Benchmark They are marked as deprecated vs. Benchmark which isn t so I assume you meant those 3 Yes. I just removed them. Hmmm I m now getting Exception in thread main java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError org apache lucene benchmark Driver java Caused by java.lang.ClassNotFoundException org.apache.lucene.benchmark.Driver when trying to run the standard bench. Looks like the build file still refers to org.apache.lucene.benchmark.Driver. Woops I ll fix the build.xml remove the old .xml files from conf.
