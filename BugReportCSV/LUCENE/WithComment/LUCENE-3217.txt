Improve DocValues merging
Some DocValues impl. still load all values from merged segments into memory during merge. For efficiency we should merge them on the fly without buffering in memory here is a patch for int variant. All fixed int variants are merged without loading them into memory and bulk merged if no deleted docs are present. I am going to commit this part of the patch soon if nobody objects. LUCENE-3507 attempts to fix the remaining issue here moving out see LUCENE-3507
