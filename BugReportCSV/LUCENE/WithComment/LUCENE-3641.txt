MultiReader does not propagate readerFinishedListeners to clones reopened readers
While working on refactoring MultiReader DirectoryReader in trunk I found out that MultiReader does not correctly pass readerFinishedListeners to its clones and reopened readers. Patch for trunk. Committed trunk revision 1213106 3.x revisions 1213110 1213112 In 3.x revision 1213116 I streamlined the code a little bit more. Most fields in MR are now final.
