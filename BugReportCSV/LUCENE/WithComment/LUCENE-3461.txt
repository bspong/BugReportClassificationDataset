Adding same IndexDocValuesField twice trips assert
Doc values fields are single-valued by design ie a given field name can only occur once in the document. But if you accidentally add it more than once you get an assert error which is spooky because if you run w o asserts maybe something eviler happens. I think we should explicitly check for this and throw clear exc since user could easily do this by accident. Patch w failing test case. Not yet sure where we should check... I think the assert is too low it should remain but higher up we should catch this. Patch catching more than one IDV fields in the same doc and throwing IllegalArgExc. Test passes now.
