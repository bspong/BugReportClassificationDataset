IndexWriter.addIndexes IndexReader readers doesn t correctly handle exception success flag.
After this bit of code in addIndexes IndexReader readers try flush true false true optimize start with zero or 1 seg success true finally Take care to release the write lock if we hit an exception before starting the transaction if success releaseWrite The success flag should be reset to false because it s used again in another try catch finally block. TestIndexWriter.testAddIndexOnDiskFull sometimes will hit this bug but it s infrequent. Thanks I ll fix on 2.4.1 as well and re-spin the release candidate.
