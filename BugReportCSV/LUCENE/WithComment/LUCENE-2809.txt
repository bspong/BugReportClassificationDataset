IndexWriter.numDocs doesn t take into account applied but not flushed deletes
The javadoc states that buffered deletes are not taken into account and so you must call commit first. But if you do that and you re using CMS and you re unlucky enough to have a background merge commit just after you call commit but before you call .numDocs you can still get a wrong count back. The fix is trivial Ð numDocs should also consult any pooled readers for their current del count. This is causing an intermittent failure in the new TestNRTThreads. Committed to 4.0 3.x... I ll leave this open to remind us to backport if we ever do another 2.9.x 3.0.x release. Let s just resolve it against 3.1 4.0 and if we do another 2.9 3.0 release we can reopen for backport. Bulk close for 3.1
