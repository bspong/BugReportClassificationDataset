Support for boost factor in MoreLikeThis
This is a patch I made to be able to boost the terms with a specific factor beside the relevancy returned by MoreLikeThis. This is helpful when having more then 1 MoreLikeThis in the query so words in the field A i.e. Title can be boosted more than words in the field B i.e. Description . I don t see any harm in this I ll make the change later this week. Jonathan would it be possible for you to update this patch to work with the trunk so I can apply it Thanks Updated to work with trunk I ll take this one. Patch looks good. I ll just add copyright header to the new unit test and change the assertTrue that compares the floating points boosts to assertEquals w an epsilon. I ll commit shortly. Thanks Jonathan
