Change AtomicReaderContext.leaves to return itsself as only leave to simplify code and remove an otherwise unneeded ReaderUtil method
The documentation of IndexReaderContext.leaves states that it returns for convenience all leave nodes if the context is top-level directly got from IndexReader otherwise returns null. This is not correct for AtomicReaderContext where it returns null always. To make it consistent the convenience method should simply return itsself as only leave for atomic contexts. This makes the utility method ReaderUtil.leaves obsolete and simplifies code. Simple patch. The only small issue is that the leaf of this context also returns itsself which should not be an issue as leaves is never called recursively in contrast to children . Updated patch for trunk. Committed trunk revision 1242233
