Javadocs for Scorer.java and TermScorer.java
Javadocs for Scorer.java and TermScorer.java Also changed build.xml to use package access for the javadocs target. That caused some minor error javadoc messages in CompoundFileReader.java and FieldInfos.java which are also fixed. The patch posted earlier for Weight.java a broken javadoc link is also included. The attached patch is for all 5 files against the CVS top directory of 28 July 2004. The only dependency is that package access is needed for TermScorer.java. This might be changed by declaring TermScorer as a public class but I preferred to use javadoc package access in build.xml over changing java code. Using package access for javadocs shows some more undocumented classes eg. in the doc page of the search package. This might encourage folks to write more javadocs... Regards Paul Created an attachment id 12253 Javadocs for TermScorer.java and Scorer.java and some related stuff. 1 for the improved javadoc comments. Thanks -1 for producing access package javadoc by default. Classes methods and fields which are not public should not be in the API documentation. Perhaps we could have a separate javadoc target javadocs-internal or somesuch that shows package and even private stuff for use by developers but the primary javadoc should only show the public APIs. I ll post a new patch with a javadocs-internal target in build.xml. This also contains the changes to the other 4 files. Created an attachment id 12256 Same patch as before but with javadocs-internal target using package access. Thanks applied and put in CVS.
