Impl toString in MergePolicy and its extensions
These can be important to see for debugging. We lost them in the cutover to IWC. Just opening this issue to remind us to get them back before releasing... Mike messageState looks like this private void messageState message ndir directory n mergePolicy mergePolicy n index segString n version Constants.LUCENE VERSION n config.toString There is a config.toString printout which includes all of IWC info. Is something else missing This line mergePolicy mergePolicy n is redundant as it s printed from config.toString . So if you intend to fix anything here this line should be removed. Hmm it looks like IW has never included useCFS mergeFactor in its infoStream output... weird I thought they did . So this is not in fact a regression But still let s fix the MPs to have an interesting toString that includes their settings not just useCFS mergeFactor but other interesting ones like maxMergeDocs MB minMergeDocs MB too . Renaming subject to a more accurate one. Will post a patch soon. Adds the toString impls Committed revision 988512 3x . Committed revision 988517 trunk . Bulk close for 3.1
