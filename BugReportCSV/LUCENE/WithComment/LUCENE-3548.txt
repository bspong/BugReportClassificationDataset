CharsRef append broken on trunk 3.x
Current impl. for append on CharsRef is broken - it overrides the actual content rather than append. its used in many places especially in solr so we might have some broken while we are at it maybe we should look at LUCENE-3277 I listed a few more things there. In my opinion the best thing we could do would be to have consistent Bytes Chars Ints LongsRef apis where all the methods have the same semantics here is a patch In my opinion the best thing we could do would be to have consistent Bytes Chars Ints LongsRef apis where all the methods have the same semantics 1 - I think we should fix the append one in 3.x since we released it and its totally broken who did this again - oh me my fault 1 to fixing things one piece at a time... no reason we have to fix it all at once fixed in trunk backported to 3.x Bulk close after release of 3.5
