Add a new TestBackwardsCompatibility index for flex backwards a 3.0 one with also numeric fields 
In flex we change also the encode decoder for numeric fields NumericTokenSteam using BytesRef and also the collation filters. We should add a test index from 3.0 that contains these fields and do some validation that field contents did not change when read with flex. Here the patech that test numeric fields generated by lucene 3.0. With the coming updates to numeric fields to use byte this will ensure that the index is compatible. Add a range for all docs to check if lower-prec terms are also ok Committed revision 928295
