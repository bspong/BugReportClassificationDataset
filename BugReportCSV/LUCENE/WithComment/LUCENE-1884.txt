javadocs cleanup
basic cleanup in core contrib typos apache license header as javadoc missing periods that screw up package summary etc. note i tried to leave UK versus US english spelling differences alone there were a few cases though where you might notice i changed this. This was only in the case where it was inconsistent in the same file i.e. a method that spells it synchronization in one sentence but synchronisation in the next. i m the last person in the world that should be reviewing a spell correction patch Ð but nothing jumped out at me as being bad about the patch... Committed revision 811070.
