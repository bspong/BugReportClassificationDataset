EnwikiQueryMaker
Mark I used this patch in LUCENE-1773 but I got TooManyClauses due to WildcardQuery fo . I commented out it in my test. Yeah sorry bout that. I had updated that query to use constantscore locally bit didn t update this yet. I use a 2 gig zipped wiki dump so I was hitting that pretty quickly as well. I ll put up another soon. fixes wildcard to use constantscore rewrite and the last query was missing its last letter changes name to EnWikiQueryMaker updates javadoc a bit - removes javadoc class header that belonged to ReutersQueryMaker changes name to EnWikiQueryMaker changes name to EnWikiQueryMaker in highlight-vs-vector-highlight.alg. whoops - that W should be lowercase - Enwiki not EnWiki I ll fix before commit.
