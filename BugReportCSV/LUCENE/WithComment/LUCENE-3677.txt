Remove old byte norms api from IndexReader
Followup to LUCENE-3628. We should remove this api and just use docvalues everywhere to allow for norms of arbitrary size in the future not just byte all tests pass ... one tweak i thought of maybe now we should rename IR.normValues String to just IR.norms String updated patch with just a tweak to checkindex. now no apis actually require that the codecs norms impl implements getArray. maybe someone wants a more compact sparse datastructure for some reason LUCENE-830 ... if they want this thats fine. But all our similarities use getArray. I think thats a fair tradeoff... if you want to use some crazy datastructure fine but you must use a custom sim too. AWESOME now no apis actually require that the codecs norms impl implements getArray. maybe someone wants a more compact sparse datastructure for some reason LUCENE-830 ... if they want this thats fine. 1 I plan to commit this one shortly and open a followup issues to allow norms to be things other than byte 1
