A new Greek Analyzer for Lucene
I would like to contribute a greek analyzer for lucene. It is based on the existing Russian analyzer and features most common greek character sets such as Unicode ISO-8859-7 and Windows-1253 a collection of common greek stop words conversion of characters with diacritics accent diaeresis in the lower case filter as well as handling of special characters such as small final sigma For the character sets I used RFC 1947 Greek Character Encoding for Electronic Mail Messages as a reference. I have incorporated this analyzer in Luke as well as used it successfully in a recent project of my company EBS Ltd. . I hope you will find it a useful addition to the project. Created an attachment id 14790 The greek analyzer main class Created an attachment id 14791 The greek character sets helper class Created an attachment id 14792 The lower case filter helper class I would be happy to commit this if you provide some JUnit test cases for it. Created an attachment id 14803 A test case for the greek analyzer This file contains strings with greek characters. Created an attachment id 14834 Updated the test case to use Unicode escape sequences Updated the test case to use Unicode escape sequences. This way it should be immune to different locale settings. Added. Thanks for the contribution and the additional test case.
