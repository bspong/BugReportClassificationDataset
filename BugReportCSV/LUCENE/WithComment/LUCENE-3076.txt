add -Dtests.codecprovider
Currently to test a codec or set of codecs you have to add them to lucene s core and edit a couple of arrays here and there... It would be nice if when using the test-framework you could instead specify a codecprovider by classname possibly containing your own set of huper-duper codecs . For example I made the following little codecprovider in contrib public class AppendingCodecProvider extends CodecProvider public AppendingCodecProvider register new AppendingCodec register new SimpleTextCodec Then I m able to run tests with ant -lib build contrib misc lucene-misc-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar test-core -Dtests.codecprovider org.apache.lucene.index.codecs.appending.AppendingCodecProvider and it always picks from my set of codecs in this case Appending and SimpleText and I can set -Dtests.codec Appending if i want to set just one. possibly containing your own set of huper-duper codecs I will copypaste that to my brain s speech centre before the talk at Lucene Revolution to entertain you again 1 this is great This means a codec writer can easily run all of Lucene Solr s tests against his her codec s ... good idea robert 1 Committed revision 1100175.
