commongrams filter calls incrementToken after it returns false
In LUCENE-3064 we beefed up MockTokenizer with assertions and I started cutting over some analysis tests to use MockTokenizer for better coverage. The commongrams tests fail because they call incrementToken after it already returns false. In general its my understanding consumers should not do this and i know of a few tokenizers that will actually throw exceptions if you do this just like java iterators and such . patch with the test modifications to produce the failure. here s the obvious solution but there might be a cleaner way to rewrite its loop... bulk move 3.2 - 3.3 this was fixed in LUCENE-3113 close issue as fixed in already released version
