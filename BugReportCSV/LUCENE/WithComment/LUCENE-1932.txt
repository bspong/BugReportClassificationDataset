Convert PrecedenceQueryParser to new TokenStream API
Adriano Crestani provided a patch that updates the PQP to use the new TokenStream API...all tests still pass. I hope this helps to keep the PQP Attached the patch. When we remove deprecations this must be applied for the PQP to compile. By the way this patch still contains some casts in getAttribute addAttribute and RangeQuery is deprecated should be replaced by TermRangeQuery Hi Uwe I updated the patch now it uses TermRangeQuery and does not cast anymore getAttribute I just saw now that a test case is not being executed exactly the one that tests precedence. The comment says failing tests disabled since PrecedenceQueryParser is currently unmaintained Maybe it really does not work and we should remove it. I can see on the documentation it s experimental could it be removed if it s experimental and not deprecated I have done this during removal of old TokenStream API.
