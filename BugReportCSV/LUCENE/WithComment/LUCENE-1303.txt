BoostingTermQuery s explanation should be marked as Match even if the payload part negated or zero ed it
Since BTQ multiplies the payload on the score it might return a negative score. The explanation should be marked as Match otherwise it is not added to container explanations See also in LUCENE-1302. Patch sets BTQ explanation as match according to score of non-payload part. Also in this patch while at it I noticed that TestBTQ sets indexing time boost to 0 and hence one assertion on search results was commented out. I canceled that and re-enabled the assertion which now passes. All core tests pass.
