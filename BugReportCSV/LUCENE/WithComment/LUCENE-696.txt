Scorer.skipTo doesn t always work if called before next 
skipTo doesn t work for all scorers if called before next . It would also simplify some scorers if doc wasn t undefined before next or skipTo was called but instead -1. This undefined nature of doc often requires more state to be kept around about the scorers. Things like TermScorer would just need a change from int doc to int doc -1 Is there any scorer that this would impose a burden or cost on Thoughts Repeating a comment just posted at LUCENE-693 skipTo as first call on a scorer should work. ReqExclScorer and ReqOptSumScorer depend on that for the excluded and optional scorers. DisjunctionMaxScorer turned out to be the only scorer I could see with that problem. Here s the patch w tests. Patch committed after further tests were added.
