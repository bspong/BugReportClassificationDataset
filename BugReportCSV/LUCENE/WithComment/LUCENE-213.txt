 PATCH Ordered spanquery with slop can fail
In CVS of 7 April 2004. An ordered SpanQuery with slop 1 querying w1 w2 w3 in document w1 w3 w2 w3 fails. It should match as w1 . w2 w3 Created an attachment id 11187 JUnit test case showing the bug I have committed this test case to Lucene s repository. I renamed it and moved it so that the spans package has its own home for tests now. Created an attachment id 11210 Patch NearSpans.java passes tests suboptimal. This patch uses AssertionError java 1.4 could be easily removed. It s suboptimal for a larger number of subspans. See the FIXME comment. I applied the patch. Thanks Paul
