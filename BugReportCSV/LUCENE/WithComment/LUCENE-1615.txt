deprecated method used in fieldsReader setOmitTf 
setOmitTf boolean is deprecated and should not be used by core classes. One place where it appears is FieldsReader this patch fixes it. It was necessary to change Fieldable to AbstractField at two places only local variables. We know this problem your fix seems ok LUCENE-1561 . We did not want to change the Fieldable interface again so we left omitTf in the interface but deprecated the methods in AbstractField Co. In future the Fieldable interface should be completely removed for 3.0 and this is a first step towards it All references to Fieldable should be replaced by AbstractField or a better alternative that also has the type in it see LUCENE-1597 sure replacing Fieldable is good just noticed quick win when cleaning-up deprecations from our code base... one step in a time OK I just committed this Ð thanks Eks
