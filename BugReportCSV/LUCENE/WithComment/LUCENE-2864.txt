add maxtf to fieldinvertstate
the maximum within-document TF is a very useful scoring value we should expose it so that people can use it in scoring consider the following sim Override public float idf int docFreq int numDocs return 1.0F not used Override public float computeNorm String field FieldInvertState state return state.getBoost float Math.sqrt state.getMaxTF which is surprisingly effective but more interesting for practical reasons. 1 Committed revision 1058939 1058944 3x Bulk close for 3.1
