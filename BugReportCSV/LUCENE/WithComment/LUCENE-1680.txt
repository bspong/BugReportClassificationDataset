Make prefixLength accessible to PrefixTermEnum subclasses
PrefixTermEnum difference offers a way to influence scoring based on the difference between the prefix Term and a term in the enumeration. To effectively use this facility the length of the prefix should be accessible to subclasses. Currently the prefix term is private to PrefixTermEnum. I added a getter for the prefix length and made PrefixTermEnum endEnum PrefixTermEnum termCompare final for consistency with other TermEnum subclasses. Patch is attached. Simon Should we just add a getter for the prefix Term to be more general Also I think we can t suddenly change protected methods to private that breaks back compat . You are right adding a getter for prefix Term is more general. I had a brief look at Term set and I missed that it is package private. Otherwise it would have been mutable and therefore I would have preferred to just return the prefix length. I added a new version of the patch. Thanks Also I think we can t suddenly change protected methods to private that breaks back compat . I meant to say can t suddenly change add final to protected methods but I see from your new patch that you understood what I meant anyway Patch looks good Ð I ll commit shortly. Thanks Thanks Simon
