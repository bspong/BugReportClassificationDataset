Remove JakarteRegExCapabilities shim to access package protected field
To access the prefix in Jakarta RegExes we use a shim class in the same package as jakarta. I will remove this and replace by reflection like Robert does in his ICUTokenizer rule compiler. Shim classes have the problem wth signed artifacts as you cannot insert a new class into a foreign package if you sign regex classes. This shim-removal also allows users to use later jakarta regex versions if they are in classpath and cannot be removed even if they have bugs . Performance is no problem as the prefix is only get once per TermEnum. Will commit this later this evening if nobody objects 1 Committed revision 937360 Bulk close for 3.1
