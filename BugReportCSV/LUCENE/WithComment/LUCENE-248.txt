 PATCH Add StopFilter ignoreCase option
Wanted to have the ability to ignore case in the stop filter. In some cases I don t want to have to lower case before passing through the stop filter b c I may need case preserved for other analysis further down the stream yet I don t need the stopwords and I don t want to have to apply stopword filters twice. Created an attachment id 12228 Add ignoreCase option to constructor and code This patch is over a year old... looks like we need a refresh. The implementation options are this patch or a new class IgnoreCaseStopFilter . I vote for this patch modifying the current StopFilter as the overhead of checking a boolean variable should be negligible compared to a lookup in the stopset. I think it s okay to committ this patch. Maybe just the lines with ignoreCase false ... could be made more readable by using an if clause. fixed a constructor bug tweaked javadoc added a simple test case committed and resolving. Thanks for the patch Grant
