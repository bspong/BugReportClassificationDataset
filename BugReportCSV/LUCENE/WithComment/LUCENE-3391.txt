Make EasySimilarityProvider a full-fledged class
The EasySimilarityProvider in TestEasySimilarity would be a good candidate for a full-fledged class. Both DefaultSimilarity and BM25Similarity have their own providers which are effectively the same so I don t see why we couldn t add one generic provider for convenience. EasySimilarityProvider added. Hinted at EasySimilarityProvider in the package javadoc. Got rid of BM25SimilarityProvider. a few comments I think we should avoid the generics here also I think the private sim should be final. If the idea is to use for non-vector space sims I think we should return 1 for coord by default in my tests it sometimes totally hoses the ranking for e.g. probabilistic models. We can also rethink the naming in that regard its just a Similarity provider that always returns the same similarity 1 I was also hesitant to add the generics because I wasn t sure about the warnings it gave. So I ll remove that happily. 2 And I guess the method parameter in queryNorm 3 I m pretty bad at naming things so I d take your advice in this. Is BasicSimilarityProvider OK Fixed the issues you mentioned. Thanks David
