Enable DocValues by default for every Codec
Currently DocValues are enable with a wrapper Codec so each codec which needs DocValues must be wrapped by DocValuesCodec. The DocValues writer and reader should be moved to Codec to be enabled by default. first taking a look at the branch just a really quick hack at a patch adding docsConsumer and docsProducer to Codec with some renaming to fit DefaultDocValuesConsumer Producer and enabling this for all codecs except preflex all tests pass but there might be some naming api issues... additionally maybe we should address the TestSort issue we want to enable this test without docvalues on Preflex... maybe we should have an explicit test for that. also we need a plain text impl for simpletext Robert patch looks great some comments the simpletext nocommit should be a TODO IMO for the preflex problem I think we need to add some infrastructure to add tests for 4.0 features somehow I will think about this one problem we are having here is that our current implementation is somewhat wasteful. Currently on flush we pull a FieldsConsumer for every codec used in the indexing session per DWPT regardless if this field is indexed. so we are creating some unneeded files if you use one field for docvalues only. The other thing is that we need to somehow reset the FieldInfo hasDocValues flag on an error when we are hitting non-aborting exceptions during indexing before we can actually create the corresponding consumer. That is something we should address in a spin-off issue I think. overall I think you should commit the current state and we work from here one more think I think preflex should throw UOE instead of returning null... At some point we should also think about a better name for Source something like InMemoryDocValues or RamResidentDocValues - something more self speaking This patch adds UOE to PreFlex codec and makes FieldInfo docValues transactional to prevent wrong flags if non-aborting exceptions occur. I also added some random docValues fields to RandomIndexWriter as well as some basic checks to CheckIndex. It s not perfect though but it s a start. Seems like it might be a good idea in RandomIndexWriter to sometimes not add docvalues Seems like it might be a good idea in RandomIndexWriter to sometimes not add docvalues yeah I think we should make this per RIW session not per document though since we already have random DocValues Types so some docs might get docvalues int xyz and some might get docvalues float xyz fields. new patch I added random DocValues to updateDocument and randomly enable disable docValues entirely on optimize commit getReader so we get segments that don t have docValues at all etc. I think I will commit soon if nobody objects. looks good i think this will help the test coverage a lot. can you rename swtichDoDocValues to switchDoDocValues fixed typo - I will commit in a second.
