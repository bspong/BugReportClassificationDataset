Nightly build archives do not contain Java source code.
Under the Lucene News section of the Overview page this item s link 26 January 2006 - Nightly builds available http cvs.apache.org dist lucene java nightly goes to a directory with several 1.9M files none of which have the src java tree in them. Fix coming shortly. Adding package-zip-src to the nightly build target. Using the zip file b c the tar version does not like file names with more than 100 chars see http ant.apache.org faq.html no-gnu-tar Scratch that comment on tar... This also requires a change to the nightly.sh script since it does some name mangling that would result in the binary and source distributions clobbering each other. I have updated nightly.sh to run package-tgz-src after running the binary distribution. I have done a few test runs and it looks good. I have saved and committed the change and it should run tonight. The src packaging will be named lucene-DATE-src.tar.gz where DATE is the date of the build. I ll keep an eye on it for the next couple of days then close this out. I have downloaded the nightly build of Jan 3 2007 and was able to compile etc. I have added a news item to the news section of the website and have committed the change.
