separate java code from .jj file
It would make development easier to move most of the java code out from the .jj file and into a real java file. Here s a first cut at this pulling out most stuff in QueryParser into QueryParserBase. This would make it easier to do refactorings and changes in Java instead of a .JJ file which isn t well supported in IDEs and allows more changes w o having to recompile the grammar. Thoughts just taking a quick glance I am really for the change. I can t stand not having syntax error highlighting in my IDE always having to regenerate the .jj file with ant javacc only to find i made a stupid typo. Here s an update that pulls out more some of the larger code blocks that were embedded in the middle of the grammar . I ll probably commit tomorrow if no one things it s a bad idea.
