remove contrib misc and contrib wordnet s dependencies on analyzers module
These contribs don t actually analyze any text. After this patch only the contrib demo relies upon the analyzers module... we can separately try to figure that one out I don t think any of these lucene contribs needs to reach back into modules here s another additional patch to remove modules suggest s analyzers dependency again it doesn t actually analyze anything so I think we should remove this dependency for simplicity. 1 ok i ll commit this soon if anyone wants to take care of the intellij maven deps please go for it eclipse is one huge megaproject with all the jars in classpath so it does not know about these things I ll sort out the IntelliJ and Maven deps in a moment. Patch which fixes the deps for Maven and IntelliJ. Also fixes incorrect IntelliJ dependencies on the common module when it should be analysis-common. I ll commit.
