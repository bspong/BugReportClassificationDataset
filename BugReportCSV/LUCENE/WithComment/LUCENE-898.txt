contrib javascript is not packaged into releases
the contrib javascript directory is apparently a collection of javascript utilities for lucene .. but it has not build files or any mechanism to package it so it is excluded form releases. My vote is to remove the javascript contrib area entirely. It doesn t really do all that much useful. I d be surprised if anyone really uses it. My vote is to remove the javascript contrib area entirely. 1. It also seems that this package is unmaintained. No files have been changed since February 2005 when it was moved from the sandbox to contrib. I think the files have not changed in a while because they work. I believe Kelvin Tan the author used uses this stuff somewhere. I m typically for cleaning things up but somehow I feel that this javascript stuff should be left alone it ain t broken is it . It may still work ok but my hunch is that changes to the QueryParser have made this javascript code more deprecated than anything. Even if we removed it from svn it historically would still be there in case anyone really needed it. Again I am 1 for removing it entirely after running it by the java-user list to see if anyone desires it. I ve emailed Kelvin and asked for his thoughts. Maybe he ll update this code who knows. Kelvin says Hey otis thanks for forwarding this to me. Fine with me to have it removed.. I ll take care of this in a few days...it looks like nobody will miss it. Done.
