Sort and SortField does not have equals and hashCode 
During developing for my project panFMP I had the following issue I have a cache for queries like Solr has too for query results. This cache also uses the Sort SortField as key into the cache. The problem is because Sort SortField does not implement equals and hashCode you cannot store them as cache keys. To workaround currently I use Sort.toString as cache key but this is not so nice. In corelation with issue LUCENE-1478 I could fix this there in one patch together with the other improvements. This sounds reasonable. Probably we could do a separate patch here and resolve this first No problem I check out a new svn trunk copy and do the changes here. They do not affect my other changes. This is rather simple only again that Arrays.hashCode appears only first in Java 1.5 see LUCENE-1415 . And juhee this is now my fifth or sixth patch for a Lucene project TIKA and LUCENE together I think I am ready to apply for Apache Contributor status currently I am only contributor and maintainer of a module in PHP core which is a Apache related project but a little bit special . As a side-note to the discussion about the serialization issues and the contributer status discussion on java-dev... Attached the patch that extends Sort and SortField by a hashCode and equals The patch of LUCENE-1478 must be modified to extend the new hashCode equals to supply equals and hashCode also for the new parser member. Patch looks good I ll commit shortly. Committed revision 724379. Thanks Uwe
