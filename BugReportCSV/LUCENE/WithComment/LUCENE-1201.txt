Add getIndexCommit method to IndexReader
Spinoff from this thread http markmail.org message bojgqfgyxkkv4fyb I think it makes sense ask an IndexReader for the commit point it has open. This enables the use case described in the above thread which is to create a deletion policy that is able to query all open readers for what commit points they are using and prevent deletion of them. Attached patch. I plan to commit in a day or two. I also deprecated the original interface IndexCommitPoint and switched to abstract base class IndexCommit instead and added equals method to IndexCommit. I also added warning this API is still experimental to the javadocs too.
