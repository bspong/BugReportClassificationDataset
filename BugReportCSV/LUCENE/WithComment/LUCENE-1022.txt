IndexWriter.setInfoStream should percolate down to mergePolicy mergeScheduler
Right now MergePolicy and MergeScheduler have their own ad-hoc means of being verbose about their actions. We should unify these with IndexWriter s infoStream. Thanks to Hoss for suggesting this. Attached patch. I made IndexWriter s message method public and changed ConcurrentMergeScheduler LogMergePolicy to call that.
