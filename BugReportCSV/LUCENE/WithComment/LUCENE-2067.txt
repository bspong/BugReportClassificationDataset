Czech Stemmer
Currently the CzechAnalyzer is merely stopwords and there isn t a czech stemmer in snowball. This patch implements the light stemming algorithm described in http portal.acm.org citation.cfm id 1598600 In their measurements it improves MAP 42 The analyzer does not use this stemmer if LUCENE VERSION 3.0 for back compat. Good stuff Robert You might wanna link to https issues.apache.org jira browse LUCENE-2034 and subclass the StopawareAnalyzer. btw. we could also rename it to SmartCzechAnalyzer Simon in this case the analyzer exists this just adds a TokenFilter to it but I agree we should use StopawareAnalyzer for both CzechAnalyzer here and LUCENE-2062 also. updated patch fixed to use Version.LUCENE 31. I also added a note that this StemFilter expects input to be in lowercase already but wants the diacritical marks to still be there. If you want to ascii fold do it after stemming. bring patch up to trunk and round out the tests and docs. This one is simple if no one objects I will commit it in a day or two. Robert I really like the readability in combination with the pseudo code in the paper The tests looking very good. The only thing I do not see in the paper is if len 1 s len - 2 e s len - 2 s len - 1 e return len - 1 durin the normalize stage. Maybe I miss something in the paper or this is some kind of optimisation. If so would you add a comment - would make it easier I also see no reason why the CzechStemFilter should be none final. Hi Simon I think you are referring to the 2007 paper http clef-campaign.org 2007 working notes DolamicCLEF2007.pdf which is very similar. The 2009 paper referenced by the code but you need ACM account to get it http portal.acm.org citation.cfm id 1598600 describes this in pseudocode as if word ends with e then replace by return Sorry for the confusion pointing you at a slightly different algorithm ... btw here is a description of what this rule does from http www.seelrc.org projects casebooks appendixcz.pdf Many words in Czech have what we call mobile e. This is an e that appears usually before the last consonant in the stem when there is no ending after the stem but is absent when there is a case ending. Here are some examples pes dog Nsg psi dogs Npl otec father Nsg otce father Gsg deska board Nsg desek boards Gpl. I also see no reason why the CzechStemFilter should be none final. I will make the stemfilter final thanks make the stem filter final and add explicit test for the mobile e rewrite make the stem filter final and add explicit test for the mobile e rewrite looks good to me Go ahead and commit. Sorry for the confusion pointing you at a slightly different algorithm ... well at least I figured out there must be something wrong well at least I figured out there must be something wrong i appreciate the review... it is frustrating that you have to pay to view the paper right now. on the other hand we are lucky when researchers that are this open about their experiments... saves a lot of work. Committed revision 885216.
