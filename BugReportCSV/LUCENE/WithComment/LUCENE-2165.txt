SnowballAnalyzer lacks a constructor that takes a Set of Stop Words
As discussed on the java-user list the SnowballAnalyzer has been updated to use a Set of stop words. However there is no constructor which accepts a Set there s only the original String one This is an issue because most of the common sources of stop words eg StopAnalyzer have deprecated their String stop word lists and moved over to Sets eg StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH STOP WORDS SET . So for now you either have to use a deprecated field on StopAnalyzer or manually turn the Set into an array so you can pass it to the SnowballAnalyzer I would suggest that a constructor is added to SnowballAnalyzer which accepts a Set. Not sure if the old String one should be deprecated or not. A sample patch against 2.9.1 to add the constructor is Ñ SnowballAnalyzer.java.orig 2009-12-15 11 14 08.000000000 0000 SnowballAnalyzer.java 2009-12-14 12 58 37.000000000 0000 -67 6 67 12 stopSet StopFilter.makeStopSet stopWords Builds the named analyzer with the given stop words. public SnowballAnalyzer Version matchVersion String name Set stopWordsSet this matchVersion name stopSet stopWordsSet And in 3.0 its simply Set . if no one objects will commit tomorrow 1 looks good. In my opinion backport is not needed to 2.9 but maybe for 3.0 Because in 3.0 there is no longer a STOP WORD-Array in StopFilter. Robert I wonder if you want to make stopSet final and assign the empty set to it in the ctor without stopwords. I always prefer an empty collection over null so you can simply replace the null checks with stopSet.isEmpty . Ð kind of unrelated and we can do in sep. issue if you want.
