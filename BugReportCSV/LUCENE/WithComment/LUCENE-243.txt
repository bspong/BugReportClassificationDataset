 PATCH setIndexInterval in IndexWriter
Following a discussion with Doug see http article.gmane.org gmane.comp.jakarta.lucene.devel 5804 here is a patch that add a setIndexInterval in IndexWriter. This patch adds also a getDirectory method to IndexWriter and modifies SegmentMerger IndexWriter and TermInfosWriter. This patch passes all tests. Any comments criticisms welcome. Julien Created an attachment id 12180 Patch for implementation of setIndexInterval in IndexWriter Created an attachment id 12388 Modified version of the patch after changes made in IndexWriter and SegmentMerger for CompoundIndex IndexWriter in the repository already has set getTermIndexInterval so I think this patch is not needed any more but thanks anyway . If there is something else in your contrib that is not in the code in the repository please attach it as a separate patch. Finito.
