Javadoc of TokenStream.end somehow confusing
The Javadocs of TokenStream.end are somehow confusing because they also refer to the old TokenStream API after next returned null . But one who implements his TokenStream with the old API cannot make use of the end feature as he would not use attributes and so cannot update the end offsets he could but then he should rewrite the whole TokenStream . To be conform to the old API there must be an end Token method which we will not add. I would drop the old API from this docs. Patxh with changed end javadocs. This patch also removes the link TokenStream s inside TokenStream.java it does not make sense to link to the same doc page itsself . Replaces code ... by javadoc 1.4 compatible code . Will commit soon. Committed revision 809381
