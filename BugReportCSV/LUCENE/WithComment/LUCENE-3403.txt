Term vectors missing after addIndexes optimize
I encountered a problem with addIndexes where term vectors disappeared following optimize . I wrote a simple test case which demonstrates the problem. The bug appears with both addIndexes versions but does not appear if addDocument is called twice committing changes in between. I think I tracked the problem down to IndexWriter.mergeMiddle Ð it sets term vectors before merger.merge was called. In the addDocs case merger.fieldInfos is already populated while in the addIndexes case it is empty hence fieldInfos.hasVectors returns false. will post a patch shortly. Patch adds 3 test cases to TestTermVectors. If you don t apply the fix to IndexWriter the tests which call addIndexes fail. It also moves the setHasVectors call after merger.merge in IndexWriter. BTW if you omit the optimize call and the fix to IW the tests pass. good catch Shai Does this happen on 4.0 too I don t think we have setHasVectors there anymore. I am just wondering since you put 4.0 as a fix version. You re right it does not happen on trunk. I still want to commit the test cases to trunk too so that we ve got that covered there as well. Therefore I think I should keep the 4.0 fix version The problem is that SegmentMerger receives its FieldInfos from DocumentsWriter and it knows whether to set hasVector according to what it receives. When you addDoc DW has FieldInfos but when you only addIndexes DW doesn t. In fact the field infos are read only on IW open ... so even if I addIndexes commit addIndexes the field infos would still be missing. A workaround I see for now is to addIndexes close new IW continue with addIndexes or optimize . Which is ugly but it s a workaround until we release a new version. I ll try that. If it s ok I ll commit the fix to 3x and the tests-only to trunk. You re right it does not happen on trunk. I still want to commit the test cases to trunk too so that we ve got that covered there as well. Therefore I think I should keep the 4.0 fix version don t get me wrong I was just double checking because 4.0 was not in the affected version. I don t wanna miss such a trap. The problem is that SegmentMerger receives its FieldInfos from DocumentsWriter and it knows whether to set hasVector according to what it receives. When you addDoc DW has FieldInfos but when you only addIndexes DW doesn t. maybe we should adopt what trunk does checking all the FI if one of the stores vectors unless you FIs is readonly If it s ok I ll commit the fix to 3x and the tests-only to trunk. 1 tests are great Phew nice catch Shai Committed revision 1162300 3x . Committed revision 1162301 trunk Ð tests only .
