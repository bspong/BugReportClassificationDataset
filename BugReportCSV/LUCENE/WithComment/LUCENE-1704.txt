org.apache.lucene.ant.HtmlDocument added Tidy config file passthrough availability
Parsing HTML documents using the org.apache.lucene.ant.HtmlDocument.Document method resulted in many error messages such as this line 152 column 725 - Error as-html is not recognized This document has errors that must be fixed before using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version. The solution is to configure Tidy to accept these abnormal tags by adding the tag name to the new-inline-tags option in the Tidy config file or the command line which does not make sense in this context like so new-inline-tags as-html Tidy needs to know where the configuration file is so a new constructor and Document method can be added. Here is the code Constructs an code HtmlDocument code from a link java.io.File . param file the code File code containing the HTML to parse param tidyConfigFile the code String code containing the full path to the Tidy config file exception IOException if an I O exception occurs public HtmlDocument File file String tidyConfigFile throws IOException Tidy tidy new Tidy tidy.setConfigurationFromFile tidyConfigFile tidy.setQuiet true tidy.setShowWarnings false org.w3c.dom.Document root tidy.parseDOM new FileInputStream file null rawDoc root.getDocumentElement Creates a Lucene code Document code from a link java.io.File . param file param tidyConfigFile the full path to the Tidy config file exception IOException public static org.apache.lucene.document.Document Document File file String tidyConfigFile throws IOException HtmlDocument htmlDoc new HtmlDocument file tidyConfigFile org.apache.lucene.document.Document luceneDoc new org.apache.lucene.document.Document luceneDoc.add new Field title htmlDoc.getTitle Field.Store.YES Field.Index.ANALYZED luceneDoc.add new Field contents htmlDoc.getBody Field.Store.YES Field.Index.ANALYZED String contents null BufferedReader br new BufferedReader new FileReader file StringWriter sw new StringWriter String line br.readLine while line null sw.write line line br.readLine br.close contents sw.toString sw.close luceneDoc.add new Field rawcontents contents Field.Store.YES Field.Index.NO return luceneDoc I am using this now and it is working fine. The configuration file is being passed to Tidy and now I am able to index thousands of HTML pages with no more Tidy tag errors. The code got mangled when converted to HTML so I tried adding pre tags to prevent formatting. Their is no preview option so I won t know if it worked until I hit the update button. Ok pre tags did not work so I took them out. I have no remedy that will make the code format properly. There is a preview button that small blue computer-like icon to the left of the yellow question mark help icon and you can use code to wrap code so Jira doesn t format it. Much better thanks. I guess I should have RTFM. OK the patch looks good Ð I ll commit shortly. Thanks Keith Thanks Keith
