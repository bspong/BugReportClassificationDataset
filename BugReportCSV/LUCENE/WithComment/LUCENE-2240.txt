SimpleAnalyzer and WhitespaceAnalyzer should have Version ctors
Due to the Changes to CharTokenizer LUCENE-2183 WhitespaceAnalyzer and SimpleAnalyzer need a Version ctor. Default ctors must be deprecated This patch add the new Version ctors and deprecates the defaiult ctor. I did not change any references as I want to split those up in smaller issues. I already changed all references which resulted in a 400k patch. We should rather do it step by step. Patch looks good I will commit this with LUCENE-2241 in a day or two.
