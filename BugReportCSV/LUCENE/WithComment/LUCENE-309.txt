 PATCH IndexSearcher.search query filter nDocs accepts zero nDocs
This caused an npe from the ht.top .score lateron. The root cause was a bug in a test case which took more time to track down than would have been necessary with the attached patch. The patch throws an IllegalArgumentException for non positive nDocs. All current tests pass with the patch applied. Regards Paul Created an attachment id 13434 Disallow non positive nDocs in IndexSearcher.search query filter nDocs Thanks I just committed your patch.
