Remove Hits
LUCENE-1290 removed all references to Hits from core. Most work to be done here is to remove all references from the contrib modules and some new ones that crept into core after 1290. Removes Hits from core and all contribs. All core and contrib tests pass. I ll have to commit some changes also to the bw-compat branch. Committed revision 822587. Still some javadocs referencing Hits remaining as well as Hits Hit HitIterator themselves. Is that okay Thanks Earwin good catch. I ll remove them. Oh man I didn t even remove the classes Hits Hit HitIterator themselves Forgot the svn rm after applying the patch. svn patch when are you finally coming Committed the latest patch.
