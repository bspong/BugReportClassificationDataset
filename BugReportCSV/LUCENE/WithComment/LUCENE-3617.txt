Graduate appendingcodec from contrib misc
All tests pass with this codec at least once maybe we don t test that two-phase commit stuff very well It doesn t require special client side configuration anymore to work just set it on indexwriter and go it now works with the compound file format. I don t think it needs to live in contrib anymore. 1. It would be nice to be Hadoop-friendly out of the box.
