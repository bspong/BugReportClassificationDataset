FieldCache should not pay attention to deleted docs when creating entries
The FieldCache uses a key that ignores deleted docs so it s actually a bug to use deleted docs when creating an entry. It can lead to incorrect values when the same entry is used with a different reader. Here s the patch... pretty simple so I plan on committing shortly. if checkMatchAllBits always has a null first parameter should we just take it out if checkMatchAllBits always has a null first parameter should we just take it out done. committed. I m not super happy with the verbiage in CHANGES.txt so please feel free to improve. Note this is also a problem in 2.9 and 3.x but any fix would be much more difficult since deleted docs are screened out at a very low level int he APIs.
