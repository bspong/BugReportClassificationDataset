Allow for specification of spell checker accuracy when calling suggestSimilar
There is really no need for accuracy to be a class variable in the Spellchecker Adds the accuracy functionality to the Lucene spell checker and also adds support to Solr. For Lucene the change is backward compatible for Solr it is not back compatible for those who implement their own SolrSpellChecker as I introduced a more future proof parameter passing capability. I also added a means for per implementation parameters to be passed in. Interpretation of those entries are entirely up to the implementation. Committed revision 987179. Trunk Here s a 3.x version of the patch Bulk close for 3.1
