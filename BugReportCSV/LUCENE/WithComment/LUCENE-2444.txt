move contrib analyzers to modules analysis
This is a patch to move contrib analyzers under modules analyzers We can then continue consolidating LUCENE-2413 ... in truth this will sorta be an ongoing thing anyway as we try to distance indexing from analysis etc Here are the instructions mkdir -p modules analysis svn add modules svn move lucene contrib analyzers modules analysis patch -p0 .. LUCENE-2444.patch All tests pass. 1 looks good If no one objects i d like to commit this first patch today to move the code in SVN. This is just a step. Then we can keep the issue open and discuss what if-any additional things should be moved to the module LICENSE NOTICE I know i have been polluting the lucene one heavily from analyzer poaching. CHANGES I think a module having its own would make sense ... other things This looks great Robert i applied this patch to a checkout then removed contrib analyzers completely. there was a problem the contrib-uptodate macro assumes contrib So this patch fixes the problem by adding a module-uptodate macro you can test it by following the same instructions but additionally doing rm -rf contrib analyzers . Committed revision 941308. Attached is a boilerplate patch for the analysis module. It contains README describing filenames etc LICENSE NOTICE describing all poached analyzers licenses etc CHANGES describing all 4.0-only analyzers changes. I yanked these CHANGES from core contrib s CHANGES file... Additionally i cleaned up the core NOTICE.txt ok if no one objects i ll commit this boilerplate stuff soon. we can try to improve the language etc later but its a start. Committed LUCENE-2444 boilerplate.patch revision 941369.
