Cosmetic JavaDoc updates
I ve taken the liberty of making a few cosmetic updates to various JavaDocs MergePolicy minor cosmetic change LogMergePolicy minor cosmetic change IndexWriter major cleanup in class description changed anchors to JavaDoc links now works in Eclipse no content change Attached diff from SVN r780545. I would appreciate if whomever goes over this can let me know if my issue parameter choices were correct yeah blame my OCD and if there s a more practical convenient way to send these in please let me know Patch against r780545 I have a couple of comments In LogMergePolicy you add a reference to mergeFactor link mergeFactor which is a private member of LMP. Wouldn t that be an issue when generating the javadocs i.e. create a link to a non-existent entity since private members are not generated in the javadocs In MergePolicy you added a link to SegmentInfo. Same as above - SegmentInfo is package private and therefore I m not sure its included in the javadocs. If I look here http lucene.apache.org java 2 4 0 api core index.html SegmentInfo does not appear there. In IndexWriter you add references like this link addDocument Document addDocument - is the addDocument in the end necessary. I ve tried it and it doesn t come out nicely in the javadocs. Same goes for link updateDocument Term Document updateDocument . In IndexWriter you replaced see a href mergePolicy with see link mergePolicy below - that s wrong for two reasons 1 mergePolicy is private see comments above and 2 the javadocs actually have an element afterwards a name mergePolicy a . The part you replaced references that element rather than the mergePolicy member which just happen to have the same name . Good comments all around I should definitely have caught all of those. I ll post an update presently. Alright I ll attach a new patch in a couple of minutes that has the following improvements LogMergePolicy You are correct. I removed the links as well as tried rewriting the paragraph to be a little clearer. MergePolicy This is not a problem it does not appear in the API but it s still linked hence refactoring tools such as Eclipse will update the link value as well as the class name and it shows in monospaced font as you d expect with code . IndexWriter Re 3 the extra token is the apparent text for the link in this case it hides the parameters . I merely translated from the previous anchor tag to links. IndexWriter Fixed a few typoes IndexWriter Reverted the mergePolicy link change IndexWriter Fixed missing IndexSearcher import for link Patch for r780565 Ok I checked and if you reference an item which is not generated in the Javadocs it appears in monospace with no link. So I guess referencing SegmentInfo is fine. Just as a FYI not everybody use Eclipse and Eclipse I think since 3.4 has the ability to update String references to class names you refactor. This look good now. Unfortunately I m not a committer so I cannot take this issue any further . Hope my review will help the committer that will choose to commit it. Thanks Tomer I just committed this. There was one warning the patched caused when running ant javadocs-core javadoc lucene src clean src java org apache lucene index IndexWriter.java 215 warning - Tag link reference not found IndexSearcher because IndexSearcher wasn t imported in IndexWrieter.java . So I just reverted that change made it fully qualified again . That s odd Ð one of the changes I made in the second version was to fix that precise warning added an import directive . The last bullet even mentions it - Anyway glad to be of help Hmm I see that bullet too but when I look at the patch it doesn t have the added import Maybe something got mixed up when you attached the patch Are there any other intended changes missing Yeah the minor typo I fixed. It s not in the diff though. Oh well I ll get it next time...
