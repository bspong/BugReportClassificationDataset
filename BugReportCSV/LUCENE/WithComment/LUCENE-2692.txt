Position Checking Span Queries
I ve created a bunch of new SpanQuery classes that allow one to do things like check to see if a SpanQuery falls between two positions which is a more general form of SpanFirstQuery and I ve also added one that only includes a match if the payload located at the span match also matches a given payload. With the latter one can do queries for items w specific payloads. Should be ready to go. Adds several new span query position checking queries. Not totally sure on the semantics surrounding the payload checking one as it is a little awkward right now handling the differences between SpanNearQuery and all the other ones Ready to commit. Committed revision 1021357.
