replace collation lib icu4j.jar with a smaller icu jar
Collation does not need all the icu data. we can shrink the jar file a bit by using the data customizer and excluding things like character set conversion tables. 5 647 316 bytes - 3 410 075 bytes. i have uploaded the jar file i created. i had to bloat it 200KB more with Misc Data for it to actually work sorry it is still much smaller 3 660 340 bytes versus 5 647 316 bytes... almost 2MB savings i did feel it was best to rename the jar file to icu4j-collation-4.0.jar This way its not mistaken for a full icu4j No script changes are necessary as it is referenced as path id additional.dependencies fileset dir lib includes icu4j- .jar I compiled this jar with the latest JDK 1.4 and all the tests pass. Thanks Robert
