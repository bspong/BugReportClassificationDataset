 PATCH public static members in class TermVectorsWriter
hi all looking at the implementation of TermVectorsWriter you ll find a bunch of public static final members where the visibility could be reduced to be protected. I don t see a reason for having them public if the class itself is protected and all members are final values. May be somebody could check and either commit or enlighten me thx Bernhard Created an attachment id 13118 PATCH public static final members in TermVectorsWriter
