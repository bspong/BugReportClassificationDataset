changes-to-html fixes and improvements
The Lucene Hudson Changes.html looks bad because changes2html.pl doesn t properly handle some new usages in CHANGES.txt. This patch addresses the following issues Release headers Release X.X.X .... can be spelled with Lucene instead of Release Lucene X.X.X ... Release versions can have .X .Y or .Z components e.g. 3.x JavaScript isOlder method had a no longer correct hard-coded regex to recognize the two latest releases. This regex is now generated from the two latest releases. code - code pre to make them look better in HTML is now blocked for inline usages so that newlines are not added to the HTML version when they are not present in CHANGES.txt. Imbalanced parentheses were incorrectly recognized as attribution onset. This patch contains several typo fixes for CHANGES.txt and one change the first item under Changes in backwards compatibility policy LUCENE-1458 LUCENE-2111 LUCENE-2354 Changes from flexible indexing includes attribution for individual bulleted items which is a new usage that I think is not intended copy-paste-o likely and several of the people that worked on those three issues are not given credit anywhere AFAICT so I ve moved the attributions attached to bulleted items to below the entire bulleted list and added everyone who posted a patch to any of the three issues. Looks good I ll commit shortly. I don t understand the Perl But I ran ant changes-to-html and the output looks good Steven can you post a 3x only patch for your fixes to lucene CHANGES.txt Looks like most of your fixes were on trunk-only entries Thanks.
