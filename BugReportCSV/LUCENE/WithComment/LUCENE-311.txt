 PATCH queryParser.setOperator int should be made typesafe
There are AND and DEFAULT OPERATOR AND in QueryParser so calling setOperator QueryParser.AND looks okay and compiles but it s not correct. I ll attach a patch that uses a typesafe enum to avoid this problem. As there s also a getOperator method I had to change the name of the new method to get setDefaultOperator. I don t like that but it seems to be the only way to avoid compile errors for people who switch to a new version of Lucene. Okay to commit Created an attachment id 13451 type safety for setOperator Looks good to me. I committed this some days ago.
