Add VERBOSE to LuceneTestCase and LuceneTestCaseJ4
component-build.xml allows to define tests.verbose as a system property when running tests. Both LuceneTestCase and LuceneTestCaseJ4 don t read that property. It will be useful for overriding tests to access one place for this setting I believe currently some tests do it on their own . Then as a separate issue we can move all tests that don t check the parameter to only print if VERBOSE is true. I will post a patch soon. Adds VERBOSE to LuceneTestCase and LuceneTestCaseJ4 as well as changes TestQualityRun contrib benchmark to use that. I didn t find any other tests which check that property directly. Looks good I did not even know this property but we can add this VERBOSE check to more tests too. The first that come to my mind are NumericRange Highlighter Spatial This is great Committed revision 922525 I only changed the protected to public to enable helper classes outside util to access the setting. As a first test with removed verbosity see revision 922528 NumericRange tests no longer prints the term statistics per default I only changed the protected to public to enable helper classes outside util to access the setting. Makes sense Uwe - Thanks I went for protected to encourage tests to extend either of the two. Helper classes however are different indeed .
