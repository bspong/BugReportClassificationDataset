DocValuesField should not overload setInt setFloat etc
See my description on LUCENE-3687. In general we should avoid this for primitive types and give them each unique names. So I think instead of setInt byte setInt short setInt int setInt long setFloat float and setFloat double we should have setByte byte setShort short setInt int setLong long setFloat float and setDouble double . In the LUCENE-3453 branch I ve removed DocValuesField.setXXX methods they are all inherited from Field.setValue instead. Likewise for NumericField which also had its own setters for numeric values with different names ... Fixed with LUCENE-3453. seems like this issue still exists. Now we overload Field setValue int long short ... Wait Ð DocValuesField.java doesn t overload any setters now right I m confused. I am talking about Field.java public void setValue BytesRef value .... public void setValue int value .... public void setValue long value .... public void setValue float value .... public void setValue double value .... Right Field.java has setters. DocValuesField no longer does nor does NumericField ie we fixed this issue that these classes were overloading the setters from Field.java . Or... are you saying this is naming issue Ie we can work out the naming do we use setValue T value or setT T value for Field.java and for the new Norm class here...
