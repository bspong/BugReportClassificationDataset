NoLockFactory should have a private constructor
NoLockFactory documents in its javadocs that one should use the static getNoLockFactory method. However the class does not declare a private empty constructor which breaks its Singleton purpose. We cannot add the empty private constructor because that d break break-compat even though I think it s very low chance someone actually instantiates the class therefore we ll add a deprecated warning to the class about this and add the method in 4.0. I personally prefer to add an empty constructor w the deprecated method but am fine either way. Don t know if a patch is needed as this is a trivial change. Attached is the patch with javadocs and deprecation. Will commit in a day. New patch with CHANGES.txt thanks Shai One addition In my opinion this class should be final. With the private ctor it gets automatically final you cannot extend without ctor but should we change this for now too This would be a small BW break. if we re breaking BW why not add the private ctor I m sure that when 3.1 will be out that won t be the only BW . Anyway this is not a serious BW. If somebody relies on the ctor then that somebody may also rely on the class not being final. I think I keep this open for a moment maybe others also have a comment about that. I would also like to make it final and private also the package private inner class . Committed revision 887995. Thanks Shai
