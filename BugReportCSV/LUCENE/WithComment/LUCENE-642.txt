New jars included nekoHTML.jar xercesImpl.jar yonik don t miss the button to add directories jars to include in contrib gdata-server lib Yonik Please don t commit this now I almost finished up the search and will increase the test coverage until the end of the week so that would be a merge nightmare for me. thank you regards simon Replaces lots of spelling. Searchcomponent included. Extended TestCases. Some Refactoring Moved 2 classes Yonik It would be great if you could get that into the svn until next week monday. So I will not change anyhting in my code until that day. That givesme enought time to do some documentation. regards simon I applied 09 08.06.diff and the libraries only. I m getting an error about a missing package compile-core echo Use gdata - compile-core task mkdir Created dir F code lucene build contrib gdata-server classes java javac Compiling 132 source files to F code lucene build contrib gdata-ser ver classes java javac F code lucene contrib gdata-server src java org apache lucene gdata search query QueryTranslator.java 30 package org.apache.lucene.gdata.server.qu eryParser does not exist javac import org.apache.lucene.gdata.server.queryParser.GDataCategoryQuery Parser Organized imports Applied against a clean copy All test passed on 2 machines best regards simon OK I checked this in because it s more of a code check-in than a patch to a stable system and the top level ant test-contrib still succeeds. ant test in the gdata-server directory fails for me on both Linux and WinXP cygwin. It also hung when I tried running it from a dir on a NFS filer. Perhaps you should do a clean lucene checkout and try that.... it you can t reproduce the failure I ll re-run and post the log. The test failed due to a class could not be build depending on a third party jar. Yonik could you run the tests after applying that path and let me know if it passed on your machine that would be great best regards simon It works now committed.
