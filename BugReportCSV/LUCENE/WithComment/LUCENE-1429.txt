close throws incorrect IllegalStateEx after IndexWriter hit an OOME when autoCommit is true
Spinoff from http www.nabble.com IllegalStateEx-thrown-when-calling-close-to20201825.html When IndexWriter hits an OOME it records this and then if close is called it calls rollback instead. This is a defensive measure in case the OOME corrupted the internal buffered state added deleted docs . But there s a bug if you opened IndexWriter with autoCommit true close then incorrectly throws an IllegalStatException. This fix is simple allow rollback to be called even if autoCommit is true internally during close. External calls to rollback with autoCommmit true is still not allowed . Thanks Jed Thanks Michael I ll try and work out the best policy for the client code that should notice OOME and react appropriately. Reopening for backport to 2.4.1. Committed revision 745788 on 2.4 branch.
