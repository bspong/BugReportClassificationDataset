benchmark pkg allow TrecContentSource not to change the docname
TrecContentSource currently appends iteration number to the docname field. Example if the original docname is DOC0001 then it will be indexed as DOC0001 0 this presents a problem for relevance testing because when judging results the expected docname will never be present. This patch adds an option to disable this behavior defaulting to the existing behavior which is to append the iteration number . btw if no one objects I would like to commit this and LUCENE-2058 tomorrow. With both of these we should be able to run relevance tests without writing java code. H... committing I want to start the release process I think both patches look good. Thanks Uwe I don t know much outside of the quality searching portion of the benchmark package so I appreciate the review. But I am trying to ab use the benchmark pkg so I don t have to write code to index a relevance collection I see no problem with disabling the doc name suffix. I think you want to use it simply to build an index using benchmark which is perfectly fine. Uwe ok thanks. is it ok if i commit these in a few hours If you want to start release process right now then I can do it immediately instead. You have time. I will do some RM practise tomorrow and will hopefully start on saturday sunday. There are some more issues open. Committed revision 835677.
