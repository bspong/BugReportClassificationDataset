If index has more than Integer.MAX VALUE terms seeking can it AIOOBE due to long int overflow
Tom hit a new long int overflow case http markmail.org thread toyl2ujcl4suqvf3 This is a regression in 3.1 introduced with LUCENE-2075. Worse our Test2BTerms failed to catch this so I ve fixed that test to show the failure. Patch. This differs a bit from the patch I posted to the dev list Ð there was also an assert that was illegally casting to int. Fixed in 3.2 4.0. I m leaving this open in case we ever release 3.1.1. bulk move 3.2 - 3.3 Resolving we can reopen if we ever want to backport to 3.1.1. bulk close for 3.3
