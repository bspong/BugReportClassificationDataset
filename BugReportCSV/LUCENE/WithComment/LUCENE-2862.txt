Track total term freq per term
Right now we track docFreq for each term how many docs have the term but the totalTermFreq total number of occurrences of this term ie sum of freq for each doc that has the term is also a useful stat for flex scoring PulsingCodec etc. . Patch adds TermsEnum.totalTermFreq returns -1 if codec doesn t impl it or if omitTFAP is on and Terms.getSumTotalTermFreq sum across all terms in this field .
