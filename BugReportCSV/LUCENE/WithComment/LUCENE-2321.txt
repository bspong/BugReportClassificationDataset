use packed ints for the terms dict index
Terms dict index needs to store large RAM resident arrays of ints but because their size is bound variable depending on the segment docs we should used packed ints for them. First cut Ð it has some limitations though Cannot handle termsIndexInterval yet forces this to 1 Loads all term data as a single byte Ð this may be a problem eg it means your total bytes for indexed terms cannot exceed 2.1B it also may fail to allocate due to memory fragmentation on 32 bit JREs. So I think we have to make this paged. Also found fixed some small bugs in packed ints. New rev Ð I think this one s ready to commit. It handles indexDivisor and pages the index term bytes allocations. Flex is winding down
