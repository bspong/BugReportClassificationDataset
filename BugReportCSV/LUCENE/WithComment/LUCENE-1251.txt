on disk full during close FSIndexOutput fails to close descriptor
The close method just does this if isOpen super.close file.close isOpen false But super.close BufferedIndexOutput.close which tries to flush its buffer. If disk is full or something else is wrong then we hit an exception and don t actually close the descriptor. I will put a try finally in so we always close taking care to preserve the original exception. I ll commit shortly backport to 2.3.2
