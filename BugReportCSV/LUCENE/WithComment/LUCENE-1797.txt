new QueryParser over-increment position for MultiPhraseQuery
If the new QP is parsing a phrase and when the analyzer runs on the text within the phrase it produces some tokens with posIncr 0 a MultiPhraseQuery is produced. But the positions of the added terms are over-incremented and don t match what the current QueryParser does. Attached patch. I plan to commit soon. linking JIRA issues
