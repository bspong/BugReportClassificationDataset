Lucene s nightly Hudson builds don t have svn version in MANIFEST.MF
Solr had the same issue but apparently made a configuration change to the Hudson configuration to get it working https issues.apache.org jira browse SOLR-684 Also I opened this INFRA issue https issues.apache.org jira browse INFRA-1721 which says the svnversion exe is located in this path opt subversion-current bin In that INRA issue etc init.d tomcat was also fixed in theory so that svnversion would be on the path the next time Hudson is restarted. Still in case that doesn t work or it changes in the future it seems a good idea to make the same change that Solr made to Lucene s Hudson configuration. Hoss can you detail what you needed to do for Solr Or maybe just do it also for Lucene Thanks Committed revision 698035. it s just about having an optional ant property for specifying the full path to svnversion ... i ve made the Hudson config changes for Lucene-trunk add -Dsvnversion.exe opt subversion-current bin svnversion and manually kicked off build 594. If i missed something re-open and i ll take a look Super thanks Hoss Indeed this is fixed we once again have the svnversion in the Lucene JAR manifest.
