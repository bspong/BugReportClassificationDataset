Parametrizing H1 and H2
The DFR normalizations H1 and H2 are parameter-free. This is in line with the original article but not with the thesis where H2 accepts a c parameter nor with information-based models where H1 also accepts a c parameter. Patch. 1 lets add these. i didnt think H1 took params the thesis says Therefore the constant of C is 1 assuming H1 then defines it without C . did the IB paper make a mistake either way it wont hurt anything to add the parameter just confusing editing fix version to 4.0 since flexscoring branch was merged i think we can safely do any scoring improvements in mainline trunk i didnt think H1 took params the thesis says Therefore the constant of C is 1 assuming H1 then defines it without C . did the IB paper make a mistake Good question. Perhaps it was a mistake however according to my colleague who had experimented with the IB method in our own engine and proposed to add the parameter to Lucene a well chosen c can improve the results. Well duh really nevertheless as long as we have defaults shouldn t be a problem. Yeah I agree... maybe in the patch we can expose the parameter to the factory in solr DFRSimilarityFactory has a param-parsing method for Normalization reused by IB too Patch re-based on trunk. I thought we had done this already but realized I forgot about it I added the solr factory parsing stuff to the patch. Will commit shortly. Thanks David
