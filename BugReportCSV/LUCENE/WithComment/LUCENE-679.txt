CLONE -QueryParser is not applicable for the arguments String String Analyzer error in results.jsp when executing search in the browser demo from Lucene 2.0 
When executing search in the browser as described in demo3.html Lucene demo I get error because the demo uses the method QueryParser with three arguments which is deleted it was deprecated . I checked the demo from Lucene 1.4-final it with Lucene 1.4-final - it works because those time the method was there. But demo from Lucene 2.0 does not work with Lucene 2.0 The error stack is here TTP Status 500 - type Exception report message description The server encountered an internal error that prevented it from fulfilling this request. exception org.apache.jasper.JasperException Unable to compile class for JSP An error occurred at line 60 in the jsp file results.jsp Generated servlet error The method parse String in the type QueryParser is not applicable for the arguments String String Analyzer org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.handleJspException JspServletWrapper.java 510 org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.service JspServletWrapper.java 375 org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspFile JspServlet.java 314 org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.service JspServlet.java 264 javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service HttpServlet.java 802 root cause org.apache.jasper.JasperException Unable to compile class for JSP An error occurred at line 60 in the jsp file results.jsp Generated servlet error The method parse String in the type QueryParser is not applicable for the arguments String String Analyzer org.apache.jasper.compiler.DefaultErrorHandler.javacError DefaultErrorHandler.java 84 org.apache.jasper.compiler.ErrorDispatcher.javacError ErrorDispatcher.java 328 org.apache.jasper.compiler.JDTCompiler.generateClass JDTCompiler.java 409 org.apache.jasper.compiler.Compiler.compile Compiler.java 297 org.apache.jasper.compiler.Compiler.compile Compiler.java 276 org.apache.jasper.compiler.Compiler.compile Compiler.java 264 org.apache.jasper.JspCompilationContext.compile JspCompilationContext.java 563 org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.service JspServletWrapper.java 303 org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspFile JspServlet.java 314 org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.service JspServlet.java 264 javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service HttpServlet.java 802 note The full stack trace of the root cause is available in the Apache Tomcat 5.5.15 logs. The original bug LUCENE-634 shows this as corrected after 2.0. I downloaded 2.0.1 on 10 06 06 and it was still broken... My code shows me to be running 2.0.1. In the file results.jsp I replaced the code query QueryParser.parse queryString contents analizer with the follwowing QueryParser qp new QueryParser contents analizer query qp.parse queryString I also changed the string url to path in the following line of code to enable the hperlinks to work from String url doc.get url to String url doc.get path Forgot to mention. I was running RHEL 3.0 tomcat 4.1.31 and JDK 1.4.2 04. There has been no official release since 2.0 hence no official 2.0.1 release ... when building from the trunk of subversion the release indicated is 2.1 ... so it s not clear to me what copy of the code you are using. Please follow up on the java-user mailing list with a clarification of of which copy of lucence you are having this problem with it s preferable to discuss potential bugs there prior to cluttering up Jira with a lot of back and forth discussion FYI The subversion trunk has fixes for both of the problems you noted. Hmmm ... I ve been wondering about this. Turns out that both the svn tag lucene 2 0 0 and the 2.0.0 src tar ball have 2.0.1-dev in common-build.xml. I don t know if this was intentional so that the someone using the signed binary tar ball would be clearly distinguishable from something that someone had built Wouldint think so but I m not too up on ASF release procedures. In any case it s easier to understand that someone will see 2.0.1-dev even if they haven t been working with the lucene 2 0 branch where I would expect it . That said what do we do with issues like this Close as a dup already fixed with a release 2.1 and let them lobby for a release if they find it critical Steven Yes that s what I d do. This bug was in demo code only after all. Fixed in the trunk. It will be in 2.1 when that gets released.
