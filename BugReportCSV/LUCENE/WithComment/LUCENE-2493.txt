Rename lucene solr dev jar files to -SNAPSHOT.jar
Currently the lucene dev jar files end with -dev.jar this is all fine but it makes people using maven jump through a few hoops to get the -SNAPSHOT naming convention required by maven. If we want to publish snapshot builds with hudson we would need to either write some crazy scripts or run the build twice. I suggest we switch to -SNAPSHOT.jar. Hopefully for the 3.x branch and for the trunk 4.x branch If we chance the jar file names from -dev to -SNAPSHOT the same build can be easily integrated with a maven snapshot repository and tested Ð LUCENE-2268 . I d like to avoid a discussion about the odities of maven but lets just take as a given that if the artifact is named -SNAPSHOT then eveytime you use it it makes sure it is the most recent version. To be able to test or have a real SNAPSHOT repository we will either have to 1. rename the .jar to -SNAPSHOT 2. run ant twice once with the current -dev settings then again with -Ddev.verrsion 4.0-SNAPSHOT In my book the aesthetic loss of -dev is worth the gain to let the maven community use and test snapshot builds. This also greatly simplifies building a test case for our maven files LUCENE-2268 Thoughts Objections Of course we should do this. I ve had to do this on my end with that -Ddev.verrsion 4.0-SNAPSHOT trick in the mean time. added to trunk and 3.x nothing in CHANGES.txt since it does not affect releases at all Bulk close for 3.1
