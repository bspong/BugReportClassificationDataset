Documentation for tii and tis files seems to be out of sync with code
The documentation on the .tii file in fileformats.xml seems to be out of sync with the actual code in TermInfosReader.java. Specifically the docs for the TermInfosIndex file seems to leave out several fields that are read from the file in the readIndex method well specifically they re read in by the SegmentTermEnum constructor but you get the idea . This has now been improved on http lucene.apache.org java docs fileformats.html I have not added information about the skip stuff as I think there s a bug in the code. I ll send a mail to the dev list about that. I compared the fileformat docs with the code and verified that they are in sync now. Looking at the code it appears that SkipDelta is only written to the tis file when DocFreq is larger than SkipInterval - the docs do not reflect this variability. Good catch Jeff. That was an oversight. I will fix this when I commit LUCENE-866.
