Change NumericRangeQuery to generics for the numeric type 
NumericRangeQuery Filter can use generics for more type-safety NumericRangeQuery T extends Number Patch that adds generics After thinking about it the whole night The static ctors cannot be removed because even with generics there is not type safety. The private ctor needs the valSize information to choose the right term encoding. This could theoretically be determined by instanceof checks but would not work if you use null for both upper and lower bounds. This generified version is easier to handle because it returns the correct type when calling getMin getMax . It also uses generics for its collections api usage. Updated patch with tests generified and also using autoboxing in javadocs and test code. Added CHANGES.txt an committed revision 820792
