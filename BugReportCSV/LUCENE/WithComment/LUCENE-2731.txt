HyphenationCompoundWordTokenFilter fails to load DTD in Crimson parser JDK 1.4 
HyphenationCompoundWordTokenFilter loads the DTD in its XML parser from memory by supplying EntityResolver. In Java 1.4 affects Lucene 2.9 but also later versions if not Apache Xerces is used as XML parser this does not work because Cromson does not even ask the entity resolver if no base URI is known. As the hyphenation file is loaded from Reader InputStream no base URI is known. Crimson needs at least a non-null systemId to proceed. This patch Lucene 2.9 only fakes this by supplying a fake systemId to the InputSource. By the way the whole loading in the TokenFilter is broken XML files should never be load by a Reader always by InputStream. The charset detection is part of the XML spec and the default is UTF-8 if not overridden in the XML file. The HyphenationCompoundWordTokenFilter supplies ISO-8859-1 as fixed for the reader so it is never possible to load other xml files with different charsets. This is another issue I will open for 3.x and trunk as it needs API change . Created issue LUCENE-2732. Fixed with LUCENE-2732.
