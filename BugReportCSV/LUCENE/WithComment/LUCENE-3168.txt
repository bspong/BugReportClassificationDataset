Enable Throttling only during nightly builds
Some of my tests take forever even on a big machine. In order to speed up our tests we should default the IO throttling to NEVER and only run in during nightly. here is a patch that disables throttling by default and enable it sometimes for nightly builds 1 we should look at speeding up a lot of our tests on developers machines... they are way too slow. we don t have to sacrifice test coverage we should instead make the iters etc reasonable and crank them on NIGHTLY. we already crank them 3x or more on 30 minute builds already too. we don t have to sacrifice test coverage we should instead make the iters etc reasonable and crank them on NIGHTLY. we already crank them 3x or more on 30 minute builds already too. I agree I will open a follow up issue. I plan to commit this soon if nobody objects.
