Move Function grouping collectors from Solr to grouping module
Move the Function Collectors from Solr inside Grouping source file to grouping module. Attached patch. I ve put the collectors under o.a.s.grouping.function package. The grouping module depends on queries module in this patch. The tests inside grouping module randomly select a term based implementation or a ValueSource based implementation Function Collector implementation . Updated patch. Added some more documentation Added missing class BytesRefFieldSource This class is now only used in the grouping test but I think is usable outside this test case as well. Updated patch. Updated to latest trunk changes. Moved Term collectors to term package. Made SentinelIntSet public and added lucene.internal to jdoc I think it is time to commit this patch. Unfortunately context diffs are hard to review in these cases when things move as opposed to just change . Are the classes just being moved with trivial changes such as package-private - public etc or are there any additional changes cleanups I only moved the Term collectors. As a result of that I needed to make two explicit changes Changed visibility of SentinelIntSet from package protected to public. Minor documentation change in package.html I could have moved SentinelIntSet to term package instead of changing visibility but now other users can use this class as well now. Maybe one day SentinelIntSet can move to core in a util package. Cool thanks for the recap. Committed in r1179808
