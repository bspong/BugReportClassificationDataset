TestFieldsReader - TestLazyPerformance problems w permissions in temp dir in multiuser environment
Was trying to setup some enhancements to the nightly builds and the testLazyPerformance test failed in TestFieldsReader since it couldn t delete the lazyDir directory from someone else s running of the test. Will change it to append user.name System property to the directory name. 2cents there s really no need for any of our tests to use the system temp dir ... the junit task in common-build.xml explicitly sets the system property tempDir as a place that tests can create files ideally they should try to clean them up when they are done Even better solution. Any reason java.io.tmpdir in JUnit task isn t overridden to point to the same place as tempDir Grant Ingersoll Center for Natural Language Processing http www.cnlp.org Read the Lucene Java FAQ at http wiki.apache.org jakarta-lucene LuceneFAQ OK per Chris suggestion I changed this to use tempDir.
