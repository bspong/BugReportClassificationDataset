Demo HTML parser gives incorrect summaries when title is repeated as a heading
If you have an html document where the title is repeated as a heading at the top of the document the HTMLParser will return the title as the summary ignoring everything else that was added to the summary. Instead it should keep the rest of the summary and chop off the title part at the beginning essentially the opposite . I don t see any benefit to repeating the title in the summary for any case. In HTMLParser.jj s getSummary String sum summary.toString .trim String tit getTitle if sum.startsWith tit sum.equals return tit else return sum change it to denotes a line that has changed String sum summary.toString .trim String tit getTitle if sum.startsWith tit don t repeat title in summary return sum.substring tit.length .trim else return sum decrease priority affects demo only here s a patch with a test... we dont even need to substring the summary... the title is never added to the summary.
