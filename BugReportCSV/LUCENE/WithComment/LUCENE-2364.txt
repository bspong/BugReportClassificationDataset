Add support for terms in BytesRef format to Term TermQuery TermRangeQuery Co.
It would be good to directly allow BytesRefs in TermQuery and TermRangeQuery as both queries convert the strings to BytesRef internally . For NumericRange support in Solr it will be needed to support numerics as ByteRef in single-term queries. When this will be added don t forget to change TestNumericRangeQueryXX to use the BytesRef ctor of TRQ. This would also make MTQ s rewrite mode internal collectors better as they convert BytesRef terms from the enums to String Terms passing to TermQuery and inside TermScorer convert back. Whith real binary terms numerics are not yet real binary they are UTF-8 conform ascii bytes this would break. Also FieldCacheRangeFilter.newStringRange but for this we need FieldCache to load as BytesRef I ll open a separate issue . Once we fix Term to take a BytesRef we should remove the newly added IndexReader.docFreq String field BytesRef term and just use the existing one that takes a Term. Maybe we should simply deprecate Term It s used in very few places now. And then require you pass in separate String field BytesRef text eg to TermQuery . 1 Term is still used at a lot of places in internal code but that can be changed easily. One of those places is MTQ Term now stores BytesRef internally...
