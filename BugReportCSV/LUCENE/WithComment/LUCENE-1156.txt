Wikipedia Document Generation Changes
The EnwikiDocMaker currently produces a fair number of documents that are in the download but are of dubious use in terms of both benchmarking and indexing. These issues are Redirect it currently only handles REDIRECT and redirect but there are documents as Redirect Template files appear to be useless. These are marked by the term Template at the beginning of the body. See for example http en.wikipedia.org wiki Template Image only pages as in http en.wikipedia.org wiki Image Sciencefieldnewark.jpg.jpg These are about as useful as the Redirects and Templates Files pending deletion This one is a bit trickier to handle but they are generally marked by Wikipedia Votes for deletion or some variation of that depending where along it is in being deleted I think I can implement this such that it is backward compatible if there is such a need when it comes to the contrib benchmark suite. I should amend the Template item. They are not useless but I am not exactly sure how to incorporate them. From what I can understand they are used for transclusion Wikipedia s term in other documents. Something like an import statement if you will. They can thus be reused across many articles. So technically in order to properly index one should resolve all the transclusions first then index. This doesn t seem worthwhile to do from a parsing standpoint. This patch fixes the redirect problem and the adds an option to discard image only documents default is to keep them . It does not strip the template pages nor does it expand them. Patch applies from contrib benchmark This version alters the ExtractWikipedia class to use the EnwikiDocMaker such that we don t have to maintain two doc producers. Doesn t do templates or pending deletions. catch the no more data exception in ExtractWikipedia committed
