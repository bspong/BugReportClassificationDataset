Build file for Highlighter contrib works when run in isolation but not when core dist is run
Build.xml for Highlighter does not work when compilation is triggered by clean core dist call. Patch has changes to fix this by updating build.xml to follow xml-query-parser build.xml Had to take out the absolute in the file refs on the patch but after I did that the patch works and fixes the compile problem. Yep I will commit shortly. Committed revision 652471.
