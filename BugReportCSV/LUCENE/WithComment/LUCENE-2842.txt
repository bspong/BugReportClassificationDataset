add Galician analyzer
Adds analyzer for Galician based upon Regras do lematizador para o galego and a set of stopwords created in the usual fashion. This is really just an adaptation of the Portuguese RSLP so I added that too and modified our existing hand-coded RSLP-S RSLP s plural-only step to just be a plural-only flow of RSLP. here s the patch. I also created vocabulary test data actual expected for the portuguese rslp from snowball data and vocabulary test data for the reference galician implementation from a small corpus. I ll attach a zip of this next. here s the test data... unzip relative to lusolr s trunk. Bulk close for 3.1
