Adding norms properties indexing and writer.infoStream support to benchmark
I would like to add the following support in benchmark Ability to specify whether norms should be stored in the index. Ability to specify whether norms should be stored for the body field assuming norms are usually stored for that field in real life applications make it explicit Ability to specify an infoStream for IndexWriter Ability to specify whether to index the properties returned on DocData for content sources like TREC these may include arbitrary meta tags which we may not want to index . Patch to come shortly. Patch includes the mentioned changes unit tests. All benchmark tests pass. I think it s ready to commit. I m hitting a failure here junit Testcase testInfoStream File org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.tasks.CreateIndexTaskTest FAILED junit creation of the file should have failed junit junit.framework.AssertionFailedError creation of the file should have failed junit at org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.tasks.CreateIndexTaskTest.testInfoStream File CreateIndexTaskTest.java 86 junit Apparently my OS currently OpenSolaris 2009.06 has no problem creating a file called ... hmm. I was afraid of that ... I think we should just delete that section of the test. If you give an infoStream file which the OS cannot create you ll get an exception. I see no reason to test for it. Would you like me to update the patch or can you just delete this part of the patch if you think it s ready to commit the last lines of the patch - 587-597 OK that sounds like a good plan I ll remove from my area before committing I plan to commit in a day or two. Thanks Shai
