contrib remote tests fail randomly
The contrib remote tests will fail randomly. This is because they use this TestUtil.getRandomSocketPort which simply generates a random number but if this is already in use it will fail. Additionally there is duplicate RMI logic across all 3 test classes. Patch that creates a RemoteTestCaseJ4 that binds to an ephemeral port 0 with a custom RMIServerSocketFactory that has access to the port number. TestUtil.getRandomSocketPort is removed and all remote tests extend this new class. Committed revision 932795. Looks fine 1 to commit backported revision 941659 Bulk close for 3.1
