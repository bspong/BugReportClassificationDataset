BlockJoinQuery advance fails on an assert in case of a single parent with child segment
The BlockJoinQuery will fail on an assert when advance in called on a segment with a single parent with a child. The call to parentBits.prevSetBit parentTarget - 1 will cause -1 to be returned and the assert will fail though its valid. Just removing the assert fixes the problem since nextDoc will handle it properly. Also I don t understand the assert parentTarget 0 with a comment of each parent must have one child. There isn t really a reason to add this constraint as far as I can tell... just call nextDoc in this case no added fixVersion 3.6 4.0 Hmm the docID passed to BJQ s advance should be from the parent docID space ie obtained from a parent-level query you re ANDing with . I can t get a test case to fail if indeed the parent has a child doc... Do you have a case Query where a non-parent docID is passed to BJQ.advance Separately I think you re right if we change that assert parentTarget 0 instead to if parentDoc 0 return nextDoc then BJQ can support parents w no children which can never match since BJQ does effectively an inner join . Thanks for fixing the parent with no children . I think there is still a problem with the assert on a single segment with one parent and child. I just took your test case testAdvanceSingleParentSingleChild and it fails for me with asserts enabled on the assert prevParentDoc parentDoc I copied over the code having problems with Lucene IDEA project config now... . Imagine there is a single parent and single child. Child is docId 0 and parent is docId 1. A filter for the parent is used in conjunction with the child query. The parent filter is used first and returns docId 1 which then the BlockJoinQuery advance is called. But because its the first parent this call final int prevParentDoc parentBits.prevSetBit parentTarget - 1 will cause -1 to be returned which will cause this assert assert prevParentDoc parentDoc to fail parentDoc is 0 . Just removing the assert fixes the problem. Shay maybe you missed copying over init ing parentDoc to -1 I don t see this assert failing Ð ant test runs w asserts . Ahh I see missed the change of setting it to -1 for calling nextDoc on parentId 0 cool.
