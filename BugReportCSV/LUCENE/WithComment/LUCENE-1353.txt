javacc ant task for contrib misc precedence query parser
Add a javacc task in contrib misc for the precedence query parser. Patch adds target javacc to contrib misc. Apply the patch from trunk. To test it cd to contrib miscellaneous and run ant javacc. It ends with applying fixcrlf like core s javacc and currently after running it svn shows all precedence javacc result files as modified. Al changes seems to be white space though and I hope these differences will go away once the result is checked in. Patch works for me Ð thanks Doron Thanks for trying this Mike I ll commit then.
