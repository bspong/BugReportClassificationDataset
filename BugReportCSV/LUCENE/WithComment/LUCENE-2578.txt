cutover FunctionQuery tests to use RandomIndexWriter for better testing
Attached patch. The only bizzare thing is... somehow the changeup in the index causes the scores to be off by a bit eg 1199.8008 vs 1199.8007 so I had to relax the threshold for comparing float scores from 1e-5 to 1e-3. We use 1e-3 in other places when comparing scores. Still these are function queries so... I don t yet understand why the scores were tweaked by using RIW. Any ideas The only bizzare thing is... somehow the changeup in the index causes the scores to be off by a bit eg 1199.8008 vs 1199.8007 OK I tracked this down it s due to the ScorerDocQueue inside DisjunctionSumScorer. The test that was failing was a BQ with 3 SHOULD clauses. The ScorerDocQueue which holds the current sub-scorers ordered by their docIDs does not break ties it has no real reason to . When you simply .nextDoc .score the matching docs these three subs scores were summed in one order. But then QueryUtil does a scorer.advance to each doc and that .advance was then pulling the matching docs in a different order from the queue. Summing the same 3 floats in different orders can easily result in a slightly different float due to different truncation. I ll commit shortly w the threshold increased from 1e-5 to 1e-3. Bulk close for 3.1
