remove random juggling in tests add -Dtests.seed
Since we added newIndexWriterConfig newDirectory etc a lot of tests are juggling randoms around. Instead this patch changes it so LuceneTestCase J4 manage the random. allow you to set -Dtests.seed 23432432432 to reproduce a test rather than editing the code removes random arguments from newIndexWriterConfig newDirectory. I want to do this before looking at doing things like newField so we can vary term vectors etc. I also fixed the solr contrib builds so they arent hiding the exceptions i noted in SOLR-2002. Awesome Patch looks good Ð all tests pass for me on beast linux . It s nice not having to pass random to newXXX. Nice work robert passes for me too. simon forgot to mark this one resolved Committed revisions 995772 995863 3x Bulk close for 3.1
