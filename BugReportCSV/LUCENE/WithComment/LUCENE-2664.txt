Add SimpleText codec
Inspired by Sahin Buyrukbilen s question here http www.lucidimagination.com search document b68846e383824653 how to export lucene index to a simple text file b68846e383824653 I made a simple read write codec that stores all postings data into a single text file X.pst looking like this field contents term file doc 0 pos 5 term is doc 0 pos 1 term second doc 0 pos 3 term test doc 0 pos 4 term the doc 0 pos 2 term this doc 0 pos 0 END The codec is fully funtional Ð all Lucene Solr tests pass with -Dtests.codec SimpleText Ð but its performance is obviously poor. However it should be useful for debugging transparency understanding just what Lucene stores in its index etc. And it s a quick way to gain some understanding on how a codec works... heh - cool Committed but I had to leave SimpleText out of the nightly rotation... some tests run incredibly slowly due to heavy reliance on the terms dict cache which SimpleText doesn t have ... I d like to separately fix that and then hopefully put SImpleText in for rotation so I ll leave this issue open for that.
