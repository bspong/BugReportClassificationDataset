Remove verbosity from tests and make configureable
The parent issue added the functionality to LuceneTestCase J4 this patch applies it to most tests. This patch removes verbosity from the surround package. With the patch applied the surround tests have no more stdout. One should first read the changed code and send the patch. Also removing an unused variable this time. Thanks. I did not change the base classes of surround only tests. Why was the stuff inside The removed code gives warnings to stdout for cases when a prefixed query term does not expand to any indexed term. In case such warnings are needed they can easily be added again for example to a separate output stream. At the time I did not want to introduce a separate warning stream because of the added complexity but I did need the warnings to verify the tests and the code. Committed revision 923112
