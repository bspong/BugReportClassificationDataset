Change superclass of TrieRangeQuery
This patch changes the superclass of TrieRangeQuery to ConstantScoreQuery. The current implementation is using rewrite and was copied from early RangeQueries. But this is not needed the TrieRangeQuery can easily subclassed from ConstantScoreQuery. If LUCENE-1345 is solved the whole TrieRangeQuery can be removed as TrieRangeFilter can be added to BooleanQueries. The whole TrieRangeQuery class is just a convenience class for easier usage of the trie contrib. As the code was not released until now this change is not problematic. If nobody complains I commit this evening One can already just do new ConstantScoreQuery TrieRangeFilter .... isn t that good enough In principle yes In relation to my latest contribution to LUCENE-1345 this may be removed in future when Queries and Filters get the same But for easier understanding the term of TrieRangeQuery should be kept. Committed change.
