Contrib ThaiAnalyzer to enable Thai full-text search in Lucene
Thai text don t have space between words. Usually a dictionary-based algorithm is used to break string into words. For Lucene to be usable for Thai an Analyzer that know how to break Thai words is needed. I ve implemented such Analyzer ThaiAnalyzer using ICU4j DictionaryBasedBreakIterator for word breaking. I ll upload the code later. I m normally a C programmer and very new to Java. Please review the code for any problem. One possible problem is that it requires ICU4j. I don t know whether this is OK. ThaiAnalyzer which simply return a TokenFilter chain with ThaiWordFilter in the middle ThaiWordFilter which use java.text.BreakIterator to break Thai words into tokens I ve changed the code to use java.text.BreakIterator instead of ICU4j to remove the dependency on ICU4j. The ThaiAnayzer is tested intensively by several groups of developers in at least two production systems by To-Be-One Technology who support the development so it is quite stable. The code is rather small cause I try to make it as efficient and easy to read as possible. It s tested in Lucece 1.4 and lately in Lucene 1.9.1. Thanks for your contribution. We re currently preparing Lucene 2.0 and as feature updates are only planned for the release after 2.0 it will take some more time to integrate this. Two remarks -It uses the english stop words does that make sense -Could you write some test cases similar maybe to those for the French analyzer -It uses the english stop words does that make sense Yes. Thai usually mix English words in Thai text here and there. So English stop words should apply but this is arguable. I ll consull with the developer community. -Could you write some test cases similar maybe to those for the French analyzer OK. I m thinking of writing them. related projects implementations SansarnLook based on Lucene with additional ThaiAnalyzer ref http sansarn.com look technique file http sansarn.com look download Pichai Ongvasith s ThaiAnalyzer ref http mail-archives.apache.org mod mbox lucene-java-dev 200402.mbox 3C20040218004604.61360.qmail web41501.mail.yahoo.com 3E file http pichai.netfirms.com thai analyzer.zip Add TestThaiAnalyzer junit test modified from TestFrenchAnalyzer. The Thai words are picked so that changing the dictionary or algorithm in JDK should not affect the test. All the code have been tested with Lucene 2.0.0. Thanks Art for the info URL. I ve never known about Pichai s work before I started this project. However I heard about NECTEC s SansarnLook when I visit them and talk about my ThaiAnalyzer. My goal for this job is for the code to be included in Lucene for Thai to work out-of-the-box. So no more wheel reinventing. I don t know anything about the Thai language ... but this code is clean fairly easy to follow and has tests that pass. If no one who knows something about Thai sees anything wrong with this implimentation and objects i ll commit it sometime this weekend. commited
