Scan method signatures and add varargs where possible
I changed a lot of signatures but there may be more. The important ones like MultiReader and MultiSearcher are already done. This applies also to contrib. Varargs are no backwards break they stay arrays as before. Is there any eclipse plugin refactoring cleanup that helps when doing this Cannot find anything Here a patch that adds more varargs where it makes sense e.g. MultiSearcher ctor to pass Searchables adding more than one sub query merge boolean queries and so on - everywhere where the array is not the meaning but more a unlimited list of parameters . If somebody finds something in addition speak load Updated patch as there may be a backwards comp problem but only if you recompile if you try to override a varargs method with an array param which is not possible . Removed the varargs from docFreq Term because of that again. Also added changes.txt. uwe here is one i found that got skipped in LUCENE-1987 Thanks I didn t check contrib. Thanks I didn t check contrib. I didn t really completely check not sure really where we should have varargs there. it does not make sense for stopwords to me but then I feel all we need is Set instead of file varargs hashtable and all the other constructors we have still i d rather have consistency for now. Yes that s right. For stopwords a varargs ctor is not really the right thing . Varargs are more for cases like instantiating a MultiReader with 5 IndexReaders or something like that. Or adding a bunch of clauses to a SpanQuery. The varargs Set is one unit arrays are not needed they are there because of BW compatibility . All these ctors except Set should have been deprecated in 2.9. Committed revision 836248
