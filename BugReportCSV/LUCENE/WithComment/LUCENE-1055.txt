Remove GData from trunk
GData doesn t seem to be maintained anymore. We re going to remove it before we cut the 2.3 release unless there are negative votes. In case someones jumps in in the future and starts to maintain it we can re-add it to the trunk. If anyone is using GData and needs it to be in 2.3 please let us know soon 1 it will still be in SVN for reference if anyone needs it. 1 I don t have the resources to maintain the gdata source code. Let s do an informal survey on the user mailing list first and see if there is any interest and maybe someone willing to take it on. I will write it up. I will write it up. Cool thanks Grant. This patch should remove everything that belongs to gdata. So far one user said on java-user that they would like to use gdata. But I think we should remove it anyway from trunk There s currently nobody who can maintain the code and it didn t change at all since we released 2.2. So people who want to use it can take the jar from the 2.2 release I m going to commit this patch and remove Gdata later today if nobody objects. Patch committed and gdata removed. After svn update contrib gdata-server is still in my working copy. Is that intended or is there still an svn delete to be done After svn update contrib gdata-server is still in my working copy. Is that intended or is there still an svn delete to be done Hmm that s strange. I tried svn up on a different checkout folder and contrib gdata-server was successfully removed. Are you sure that you don t have any local changes in that folder that prevent it from being removed contrib gdata-server is recorded as deleted so an svn status will show that subversion doesn t know anything about it but if you ve ever build gdata-server then it contains an ext-libs directory which was not managed by subversion so svn update won t delete it automatically. Hoss That must have been the cause. After removing the gdata-server directory manually everything is in order. Thanks.
