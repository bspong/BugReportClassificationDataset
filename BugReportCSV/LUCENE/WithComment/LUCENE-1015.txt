FieldCache should support longs and doubles
Would be nice if FieldCache supported longs and doubles Of course since FieldCache is an interface we need to think about back-compatibility... First draft at a patch to add long and double FieldCache support by extending the FieldCache interface can t just add b c of back-compatibility reasons . Adds support in the SortField and the two HItQueue s. Still needs to be more thoroughly tested but wanted to get comments first. Finishing up LUCENE-831 would seem like a good way to add this as well Ð while also getting the juicy benefits of 831 combined with 743. Of course this only applies if someone where to finish 831 and it where accepted... I am going to commit this sometime tomorrow unless there are objections. It doesn t sound like anyone is stepping up on 831 at the moment so they can refactor as necessary. Will also add in the necessary testing. While you re at it would you mind adding shorts as well When you have a lot of docs in a collection the space savings realized by using shorts instead of ints can make a real difference in the number of docs supportable on a given hardware platform. Good idea will do. Actually the FieldCache already supports byte and shorts. Added tests fixed some documentation bugs. Will commit tonight or tomorrow Committed.
