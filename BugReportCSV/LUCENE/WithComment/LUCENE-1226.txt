IndexWriter.addIndexes IndexReader fails to create compound files
Even if no exception is thrown while writing the compound file at the end of the addIndexes call the transaction is rolled back and the successfully written cfs file deleted. The fix is simple There is just the success true statement missing at the end of the try clause. All tests pass. I ll commit this soon to trunk and 2.3.2. Committed to trunk 2.3 branch.
