MultiSearcher.explain returns incorrect score explanation relating to docFreq
Creating 2 different indexes searching each individually and print score details and compare to searching both indexes with MulitSearcher and printing score details. The docFreq value printed isn t correct - the values it prints are as if each index was searched individually. Code is like MultiSearcher multi new MultiSearcher searchables Hits hits multi.search query for int i 0 i hits.length i Explanation expl multi.explain query hits.id i System.out.println expl.toString I raised this in the Lucene user mailing list and was advised to log a bug email thread given below. Original Message From Chris Hostetter Sent Friday December 07 2007 10 30 PM To java-user Subject Re does the MultiSearcher class calculate IDF properly a quick glance at the code seems to indicate that MultiSearcher has code for calcuating the docFreq accross all of the Searchables when searching or when the docFreq method is explicitly called but that explain method just delegates to Searchable that the specific docid came from. if you compare that Explanation score you got with the score returned by a HitCollector or TopDocs they probably won t match. So i would say yes MultiSearcher calculates IDF properly but MultiSeracher.explain is broken. Please file a bug about this i can t think of an easy way to fix it but it certianly seems broken to me. Subject does the MultiSearcher class calculate IDF properly I tried the following. Creating 2 different indexes search each individually and print score details and compare to searching both indexes with MulitSearcher and printing score details. The docFreq value printed don t seem right - is this just a problem with using Explain together with the MultiSearcher Code is like MultiSearcher multi new MultiSearcher searchables Hits hits multi.search query for int i 0 i hits.length i Explanation expl multi.explain query hits.id i System.out.println expl.toString Output id 14 score 0.071 0.07073946 MATCH fieldWeight contents climate in 2 product of 1.0 tf termFreq contents climate 1 1.8109303 idf docFreq 1 0.0390625 fieldNorm field contents doc 2 clarifying summary and cleaning up description formating and removing spam bait Not sure how to fix this but I think LUCENE-1771 will make it a bit easier - if we can just get the multi searcher passed as the searcher to explain searcher reader doc it would pull the right numbers. Not sure how to do that though - as it is it looks like explain on MultiSearcher is going to get left out in the cold - MultiSearcher works with Searchables but Searchable explain is deprecated with the replacement on Searcher. Thats trouble for MultiSearcher explain. as it is it looks like explain on MultiSearcher is going to get left out in the cold - MultiSearcher works with Searchables but Searchable explain is deprecated with the replacement on Searcher. Thats trouble for MultiSearcher explain. Looks like I left it out in the cold This was a mistake when reverting from QueryWeight to Weight - I missed removing this deprecation. fixed and committed r806561 Thanks for the report Yasoja This has been fixed in the linked issue.
