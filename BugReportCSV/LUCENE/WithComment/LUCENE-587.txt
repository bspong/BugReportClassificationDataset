Explanation.toHtml outputs invalid HTML
If you want an HTML representation of an Explanation you might call the toHtml method. However the output of this method looks like the following ul li some value some description li ul li some nested value some description li ul ul As it is illegal in HTML to nest a UL directly inside a UL this method will always output unparseable HTML if there are nested explanations. What Lucene probably means to output is the following which is valid HTML ul li some value some description ul li some nested value some description li ul li ul thanks forspotting this. I ve commited a fix that basically does what you suggest but includes a br between the description and hte nested explanations. Sorry I think the fix in not correct. Output now starts with li but li must always be inside ul . Sorry I must have looked at the wrong output. You re right it seems to be okay now.
