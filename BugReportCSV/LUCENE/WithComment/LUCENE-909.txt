Demo targets for running the demo
Now that the demo build targets are working and build the jar war it may be useful for users to also be able to run the demo with something like ant run-demo . This complements existing docs demo.html. The patch 1 adds 4 targets to demo s build file demo-index-html - Run html indexing demo index the javadocs . demo-index-text - Run text indexing demo index the sources of the demo . demo-search-html - Run interactive search demo. demo-search-text - Run interactive search demo. 2 changes the search demo interactive print statements which ask user input to println so that the request for input shows also when the demo runs from ant ant buffers the output until it detects eol found no way around this . 3 fixes a minor search demo bug so that it now exists nicely when entering an empty query string. In 3 above it should be exits not exists ... I will commit this if there are no objections. I just tried it out. Works great Doron 1 for committing. Minor question Should ant clean also remove the directories demo-html-dir and demo-text-dir Good idea I ll add that thanks committed including Michael s suggestion clean deletes demo index dirs .
