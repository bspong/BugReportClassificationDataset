IndexReader currently has javadoc errors
Current trunk has some javadoc errors in IndexReader and some more in contrib. Fixes javadoc errors in IndexReader. Remaining javadoc errors are in contrib ant contrib lucli contrib regex Thanks I just committed the patch. However I cannot see errors in lucli can you make a patch for those cases too Here the javadoc output after the patch thanks has warnings on missing packages classes jtidy in HtmlDocument.java in contrib ant jline in Licli.java and LuceneMethods.java in contrib lucli ConsoleReader in LuceneMethods.java in contrib lucli. and a few more warnings also in contrib regex. But there are only warnings not errors as I reported earlier. The warnings about the missing packages and classes might be fixed by adding these packages to the javadoc class path. In contrib regex there is a reference not found RegexCapabilities but I don t know what is intended there. The javadoc for the core is clean again and that is enough for me now.
