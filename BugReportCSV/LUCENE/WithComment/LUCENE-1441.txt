KeywordTokenizer does not set start end offset of the Token it produces
I think just adding these two lines in the next Token method is the right fix reusableToken.setStartOffset 0 reusableToken.setEndOffset upto I don t think this is a back compat issue because the start end offset are now meaningless since they will inherit whatever the reusable token had previously been used for. Attached patch. I plan to commit shortly. Committed revision 712232.
