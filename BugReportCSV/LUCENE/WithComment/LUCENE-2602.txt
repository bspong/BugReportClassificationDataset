Default merge policy should take deletions into account
LUCENE-1634 added a calibrateSizeByDeletes we had a TODO to default this to true as of 3.0 but we missed it. I ll fix it now for 3.1 and 4.0. While this is technically a change in back-compat for 3.x I think it s fine to make an exception here this should be a big win for indices that have high doc turnover with time. Great - I meant to add this as a default for solr quite some time ago. REMINDER to self mainly or anyone else willing need to verify that solr correctly picks up this default i.e doesn t accidentally override it . I know there were related issues like SOLR-1444. Bulk close for 3.1
