improve test coverage for Multi 
It seems like an easy win that when the test calls newSearcher it should sometimes wrap the reader with a SlowMultiReaderWrapper. Here s a patch I think i fixed the various false fails but it would be good to beast the tests a few times to see if there are any left. Also tried to make TestRegexpRandom2 meaner... I did hit one fail ant test -Dtestcase TestIndexWriterExceptions -Dtestmethod testExceptionsDuringCommit -Dtests.seed -2996541401386755449 -7422779128529852458 Not sure if its windows-only and likely unrelated but for the seed to work you probably need to apply this patch... Ah please ignore that one pretty sure this one is LUCENE-3025 LUCENE-2991 all over again... it fails on trunk too. Update patch fixes false fail in TestMatchAllDocsQuery found by selckin http www.selckin.be trunk-3053-0.txt Updated patch fixes another false fail in xml-query-parser http www.selckin.be trunk-3053-p2-0.txt Patch looks good Robert Ð make our tests eviler Committed revision 1098303 1098329 branch 3x Bulk closing for 3.2
