Add a TypeTokenFilter
It would be convenient to have a TypeTokenFilter that filters tokens by its type either with an exclude or include list. This might be a stupid thing to provide for people who use Lucene directly but it would be very useful to later expose it to Solr and other Lucene-backed search solutions. A very basic TypeTokenFilter can be implemented extending a FilteringTokenFilter where the accept method checks on a stopType set for the typeAttribute.type matching. Patch looks good Tommaso though I think stopTypes should be Set String because type attribute is a string. Thanks Robert you re right. Updated patch attached. updated patch with unit test Hi Tommaso Nice work I will commit this if nobody objects Thanks Uwe for taking care of it Committed trunk revision 1234396 Committed 3.x revision 1234397 Tommaso Can you maybe provide a Solr factory in a separate Solr issue or reopen this one Sure Uwe I ll open a new one for the related Solr factory Uwe looks like you committed as LUCENE-3121 by accident... Oh did I use wrong issue number I ll fix commit messages Fixed I am so sorr . Was a copypaste error from previous CHANGES.txt entry I duplicated to edit. I used the entry as commit message with wrong issue number too. That s how it happened
