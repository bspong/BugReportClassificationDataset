Resolve JUnit assert deprecations
Many tests use assertEquals methods which have been deprecated. The culprits are assertEquals float float assertEquals double double and assertEquals Object Object . Although not a big issue they annoy me every time I see them so I m going to fix them. Patch which adds appropriate epsilons to the float and double assertions and converts array assertions to assertArrayEquals. Everything passes. Once this is committed I want to nuke the deprecated assert methods from LuceneTestCase as they re no longer used. Yay nice cleanup Committed revision 1166582. Trivial patch which removes the deprecated assertEquals methods from LuceneTestCase. Committed revision 1167468. Reopening for 3x backport 3x backport Committed revision 1167511. Bulk close after release of 3.5
