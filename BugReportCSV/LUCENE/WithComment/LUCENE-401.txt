 PATCH fixes for gcj target.
I ve modified the Makefile so that it compiles with GCJ-4.0. This involved fixing the CORE OBJ macro to match the generated jar file as well as excluding FieldCacheImpl from being used from its .java source GCJ has problems with anonymous inner classes I guess . Also I changed the behaviour of FieldInfos.fieldInfo int . It depended on catching IndexOutOfBoundsException exception. I ve modified it to test the bounds first returning -1 in that case. This helps with gcj since we build with -fno-bounds-check. I compiled with GCJ gcj-4.0 GCJH gcjh-4.0 GPLUSPLUS g -4.0 ant clean gcj patch to follow. Created an attachment id 15513 Patch for gcj Makefile and FieldInfos exception handling. In reply to comment 1 Created an attachment id 15513 edit Patch for gcj Makefile and FieldInfos exception handling. Oh I m running Debian with a 2.6.11 kernel. I have the gcc-4.0 packages from the unstable distribution. Closing because we no longer support GCJ.
