processing a synonym in a token stream will remove the following token from the stream
If you do a phrase search on a field derived from a fieldtype with the synonym filter which includes a synonym the term following the synonym vanishes after synonym expansion. e.g. http host port solr corename select q desc 22xyzzy 20 20bbb 20pot 20of 20gold 22 version 2.2 start 0 rows 10 indent on debugQuery true bbb is in the default synonyms file desc is a text fieldtype outputs .... str name rawquerystring desc xyzzy bbb pot of gold str str name querystring desc xyzzy bbb pot of gold str str name parsedquery PhraseQuery desc xyzzy bbbb 1 bbbb 2 of gold str str name parsedquery toString desc xyzzy bbbb 1 bbbb 2 of gold str .... You can also see this behavior using the admin console analysis.jsp Solr 3.3 behaves properly. Here s a test case of the bug thanks for reporting this Simon updated test that includes an expansion of the case where bbb maps to 3 words in this case it nukes of also... so now we can see the general pattern of the bug. Nice catch Ð thanks Simon The attached patch should fix the issue. The problem was we were allowing preserveOrig to apply across all output d tokens not just the matched input tokens. Mike s patch but i ported the tests from the old synfilter to boost our test coverage a little bit. we could still cleanup and improve these tests but it makes me feel better. Thanks again Simon
