The terms index divisor in IW should be set via IWC not via getReader
The getReader call gives a false sense of security... since if deletions have already been applied and IW is pooling the readers have already been loaded with a divisor of 1. Better to set the divisor up front in IWC. This is already set on IWC set getReaderTermsIndexDivisor . So I guess all that s needed is to deprecate IW.getReader int on 3x and remove from trunk So I guess all that s needed is to deprecate IW.getReader int on 3x and remove from trunk 1 Though it s already removed on trunk. So we just need to deprecate on 3.x... You re right Mike. I committed the deprecation note to revision 1060545. Bulk close for 3.1
