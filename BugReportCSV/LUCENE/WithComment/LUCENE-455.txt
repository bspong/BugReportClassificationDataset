FieldsReader does not regard offset and position flags
When creating a Field the FieldsReader looks at the storeTermVector flag of the FieldInfo. If true Field.TermVector.YES is used as parameter. But it should be checked if storeOffsetWithTermVector and storePositionWithTermVector are set and Field.TermVector.WITH OFFSETS ...WITH POSITIONS or ...WITH POSITIONS OFFSETS should be used as appropriate. Here is a patch that solves the problem. The FieldsReader now looks at FieldInfo.storeOffsetWithTermVector and FieldInfo.storePositionWithTermVector and creates the Field with the correct TermVector parameter. Frank thanks for the patch. I ve reviewed it and commited it. Bernhard
