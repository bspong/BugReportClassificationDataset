add Deprecated annotations
as discussed on LUCENE-2084 I think we should be consistent about use of Deprecated annotations if we are to use it. This patch adds the missing annotations... unfortunately i cannot commit this for some time because my internet connection does not support heavy committing it is difficult to even upload a large patch . So if someone wants to take it have fun otherwise in a week or so I will commit it if nobody objects. Attaching patch for Robert. The justification for using Deprecated AFAICT is that conforming compilers are required to issue warnings for each so-annotated class method where compilers are not required to issue warnings for javadoc deprecated tags and although Sun compilers do this other vendors compilers might not. Another similarly theoretical argument in favor of using Deprecated annotations is that unlike deprecated javadoc tags this annotation is available via runtime reflection. A random information point MYFACES-2135 removed all Deprecated annotations from MyFaces code because an apparent bug in the Sun TCK flags methods bearing this annotation as changing method signatures. Steven yeah i know theoretically why this is here but it is completely stupid. Deprecated is a gigantic mistake requiring me to write it twice once lowercase in the javadocs once uppercase as an annotation. This is the only way to properly deprecate something with a message as to why. and so this additional work buys me nothing except some theoretical workaround to sun s piss-poor broken language design. this being said i still think we should be consistent either remove all these annotations or add them all and not just use them sometime . Committed revision 895342 to trunk. I added flex branch here after the next time trunk is merged to it we should do the same there. patch for flex also RegexTermsEnum is undeprecated as it was accidentally deprecated in favor of itself. Committed revision 899831 to flex
