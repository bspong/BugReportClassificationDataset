remove IndexSearcher.docFreq maxDoc
As pointed out by Mark on SOLR-1632 these are no longer used by the scoring system. We ve added new stats to Lucene so having these methods on indexsearcher makes no sense. Its confusing to people upgrading if they subclassed IndexSearcher to provide distributed stats only to find these are not used LUCENE-3555 has a correct API for them to do this . So I think we should remove these in 4.0. Patch in lucene this was only called by things like tests for the most part. The spellchecker used docFreq as an existence check I added a TODO here as there are better faster ways to do this trunk with seekExact. Solr uses this as a convenience method everywhere so I put these methods on SolrIndexSearcher but made them final so there is no trap. 1
