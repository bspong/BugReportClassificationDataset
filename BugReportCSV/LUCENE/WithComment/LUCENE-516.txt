TestFSDirectory fails on Windows
 ant test generates the following error consistently when run on a Windows machine even when run as user with Administrator privileges junit Testcase testTmpDirIsPlainFile org.apache.lucene.index.store.TestFSDirectory Caused an ERROR junit Access is denied junit java.io.IOException Access is denied junit at java.io.WinNTFileSystem.createFileExclusively Native Method junit at java.io.File.createNewFile File.java 828 junit at org.apache.lucene.index.store.TestFSDirectory.testTmpDirIsPlainFile TestFSDirectory.java 66 The test fails for me too. I looked into it a while ago and a way to fix it wasn t obvious. The author has indicated that it could be removed and I just did that.
