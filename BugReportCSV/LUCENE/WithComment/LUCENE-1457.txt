There are a few binary search implmentations in lucene that suffer from a now well known overflow bug
http googleresearch.blogspot.com 2006 06 extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html The places I see it are MultiSearcher.subSearcher int TermInfosReader.getIndexOffset Term MultiSegmentReader.readerIndex int int int MergeDocIDRemapper.remap int I havn t taken much time to consider how likely any of these are to overflow. The values being averaged would have to be very large. That would rule out possible problems for at least a couple of these but how about something like the MergeDocIDRemapper Is there a document number that could be reached that has a chance of triggering this bug If not we can close this and have a record of looking into it. Committed revision 723149. I fixed these cases plus one more in FieldCache. Thanks Mark Reopening for backport to 2.4.1. Committed revision 745798 on 2.4 branch.
