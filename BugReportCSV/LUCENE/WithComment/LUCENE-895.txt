Exclude PrecedenceQueryParser from build or disable failing test cases
As Erik commented in LUCENE-885 the PrecendenceQueryParser is currently unmaintained. Since some tests are failing we should either exclude PQP from the build or simply disable the failing tests. This simple patch disables the three failing tests testSimple testWildcard and testPrecedence . Together with Lucene-885 all core and contrib tests pass. Michael the javadocs for PrecedenceQueryParser do mention it s experimental and There are still some open issues with this parser. ...but if we re disabling some tests it would be good explicitly refer people to those tests in the javadoc so they know exactly what the open issues are. I just committed this with comments about the disabled tests. Thanks Hoss
