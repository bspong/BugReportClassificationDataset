remove unused benchmark dependencies
Benchmark has a huge number of jar files in its lib some of which even have different versions than the same libs used in e.g. solr But the worst thing is most of these it doesn t even use. commons-collection unused commons-beanutils unused commons-logging unused commons-digetser unused Good cleaning job. 1 Heh. You could run all tests with -verbose class and then grep for locations which were actually used. Evil. The four you are mention here are the ones required including commons-digester. Digester was used in very early versions of benchmark maybe to extract some xml files and convert to Lucene document objects. Heh. You could run all tests with -verbose class and then grep for locations which were actually used. Evil. An if only one class out of a 15 MB JAR archive are used then there is something wrong
