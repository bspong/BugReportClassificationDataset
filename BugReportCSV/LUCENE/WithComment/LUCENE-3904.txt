Similarity javadocs look ugly if created with java7 s javadoc
The captions used to illustrate the formulas are tables here in jdk 5 6 the table is centered nicely. But with java7 s javadocs I think due to some css styles changes the table is not centered but instead stretched. I think we just need to center this table with a different technique Have a look at http people.apache.org rmuir java7-style-javadocs org apache lucene search Similarity.html to see what I mean. NOTE these javadocs are under TFIDFSimilarity.java in trunk. patch against 3x... i plan to just port forward to trunk. The problem was that java7 s default table style has width 100 so we need to explicitly set it to auto for these captions. Additionally we need to ensure the text is actually centered for formulas where we have A B. This changes nothing for java5 6 but fixes the issue for java7. I just had quick look .. in stylesheet.css on line 345 is a declaration for .contentContainer ul li table .classUseContainer ul li table .constantValuesContainer ul li table width 100 which expands the table. the fix would be to remove this but i don t know if there are tables which requires this In the attached Screenshot i ve modified the Source w Chrome Dev-Tools and set width auto see at the right bottom and it s no longer expanded. Does this help Stefan that was exactly the problem Additionally when we had a math formula with something like A B such as the 1 sumOfSquaredWeights 1 2 the text wasn t being centered but that was more minor. Can you review my patch Can you review my patch 1 looks good a screenshot of the java7 docs with the patch Thanks Stefan
