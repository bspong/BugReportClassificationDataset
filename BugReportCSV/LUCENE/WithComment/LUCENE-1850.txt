Update overview example code
See http lucene.apache.org java 2 4 1 api core overview-summary.html - need to update for non-deprecated best-practices recommended API usage. Also double-check that the demo app works as documented. Just noticed - thats 2.4.1 - thats why its using Hits - it has been updated to use non deprecated since then. I have fixed changed up some other little things though - or at least improved - including updating analysis section to be more up to date. I ll look at the demos next to be sure they are good. updated demo - resolving - again I may do more here but I think I have addressed enough to close the ticket.
