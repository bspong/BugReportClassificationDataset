IndexReader.setTermInfosIndexDivisor doesn t carry over to reopened readers
When you reopen a reader some segments are shared and thus properly inherit the index divisor but others are newly opened and use the default index divisor. You then have no way to change the index divisor of those newly opened ones. The only workaround is to not use reopen always open a new reader . I d like to make termInfosDivisor an up-front param to IndexReader anyway for LUCENE-1609 so likely I ll fix both of these issues there. perfect i had checked your last patch on LUCENE-1609 and hadn t seen any explicit handling of this situation yet so just wanted to call it out Thanks Tim. This should be fixed with LUCENE-1609 DirectoryReader now holds onto the termInfosIndexDivisor and passes it when opening new SegmentReaders during reopen. Fixed with LUCENE-1609.
