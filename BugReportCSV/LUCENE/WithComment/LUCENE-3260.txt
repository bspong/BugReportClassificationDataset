need a test that uses termsenum.seekExact which returns true then calls next 
i tried to do some seekExact where the result must exist then next ing in the faceting module and it seems like there could be a bug here. I think we should add a test that mixes seekExact seekCeil next like this to ensure that if seekExact returns true that the enum is properly positioned. Patch w new test showing the issue in MTE when you next after seekExact and w the fix for MTE. I also removed unnecessary seek calls from LuceneTaxonomyWriter. Patch looks good Mike. One minor comment atLeast 200 means we ll always run at least 200 iterations. Did you do it only for capturing the bug Robert and Simon have done a great job at speeding up tests so perhaps we should have a lower value like 10 here Thanks Shai The 200 iterations are exceptionally fast since they only do 1 TermsEnum op per iter it s the indexing that ll be slow in this test Ð for that I do numDocs atLeast 10 . Also this bug only happens when seekExact is followed by next only on certain terms and only on a multi-seg index. So it seems an OK investment of CPU for test coverage I see. Thanks for the clarification. 1 to commit.
