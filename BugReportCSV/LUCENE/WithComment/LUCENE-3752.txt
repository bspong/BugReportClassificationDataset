move preflexrw to lucene3x package
Currently there are a lot of things made public in lucene3x codec but all marked internal experimental deprecated. A lot of this is just so our test codec preflexrw can subclass it. I think we should just move it to the same package then it call all be package-private. 1 1 Thanks for the comments guys Ill do the svn moves and make it all package-private Except the codec . I think it was especially confusing to see SegmentTerm Enum Docs Positions that resemble 3.x apis as public classes in 4.0 even if they are deprecated experimental internal full of warnings ... they are really internal implementation details Committed revision 1240750.
