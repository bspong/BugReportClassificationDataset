IndexReader.lastModified String dir or its variants always return NPE on 2.3 perhaps something to do with SegmentInfo. Could you provide more details here That method returns a long so it can t return null. Do you mean it s returning 0 TestIndexReader has a case that tests this method and it seems to be working from what I can tell. sorry i mean i get a npe when i called IndexReader.lastModified it s was working fine in lucene 2.1 and below. by the way. here is the stack trace. java.lang.NullPointerException at org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos FindSegmentsFile.run SegmentInfos.java 534 at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader.lastModified IndexReader.java 286 at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader.lastModified IndexReader.java 275 at com.alanboo.lucene.test.AbstractCollection.getDateIndexedAsString Unknown Source at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0 Native Method at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java 39 at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java 25 at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke Method.java 589 OK I see this issue.
