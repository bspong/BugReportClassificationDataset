Move ReusableAnalyzerBase into core
In LUCENE-2309 it was suggested that we should make Analyzer reusability compulsory. ReusableAnalyzerBase is a fantastic way to drive reusability so lets move it into core so that we can then change all impls over to using it . I agree we should push this logic into analyzer. the first step to doing this is sort of a nightmare i think that is to remove tokenStream and only support reusableTokenStream in all the tests etc... it seems easy but its a ton of work actually. My plan was to move the class ReusableAnalyzerBase into core and then port all Analyzers over to using it. Then I would drop tokenStream and rename ReusableAnalyzerBase to just Analyzer. Manageable Patch which moves ReusableAnalyzerBase into core and updates all references. Command svn move modules analysis common src java org apache lucene analysis util ReusableAnalyzerBase.java lucene src java org apache lucene analysis ReusableAnalyzerBase.java Updated patch including CHANGES.txt entry. Will commit tomorrow Committed revision 1160117.
