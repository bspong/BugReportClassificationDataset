Make FieldSelector usable from Searchable
Seems reasonable that you would want to be able to specify a FieldSelector from Searchable because many systems do not use IndexSearcher where you can get a Reader but instead use Searchable or Searcher so that Searchers and MultiSearchers can be used in a polymorphic manner. The patch misses adding the doc int FieldSelector method to Searcher which I don t think is necessary but fits with the style of the current code. Applied patch. Added unit tests to TestMultiSearcher and TestRemoteSearchable. As a result of the Remote test had to make FieldSelector and FieldSelectorResult serializable.
