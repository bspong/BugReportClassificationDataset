Searchable.java The info in the deprecated tags do not refer to the search Weight etc... versions...
E.g. The javadoc for void search Query query Filter filter HitCollector results states Deprecated. use search Query Filter HitCollector instead. instead of Deprecated. use search Weight Filter HitCollector instead. diff for the four changes. Thanks for the patch Luc I had noticed that before too but it dropped out of by brain . Patch committed.
