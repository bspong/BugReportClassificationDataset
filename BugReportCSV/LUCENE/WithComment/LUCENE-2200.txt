Several final classes have non-overriding protected members
Protected member access in final classes except where a protected method overrides a superclass s protected method makes little sense. The attached patch converts final classes protected access on fields to private removes two final classes unused protected constructors and converts one final class s protected final method to private. All tests pass with the attached patch applied. Steve I briefly looked at your patch. Could we make some of the member vars final too The reader in CharReader or the defaultAnalyzer in ShingleAnalyzerWrapper for instance. simon Could we make some of the member vars final too Done in the new version of the patch. Note that I didn t try to look in classes other than those already modified in the previous version of the patch for final class member access modification. FYI all tests pass for me with the new version of the patch applied. all tests pass and patch looks good to me. will commit at the end of the day. Robert when you commit this make sure you mark the Attributes in EdgeNGramTokenFilter.java final thanks. Steve thanks for the patch such work is always appreciated. simon Robert when you commit this make sure you mark the Attributes in EdgeNGramTokenFilter.java final thanks. Whoops I missed those - thanks for checking Simon. minGram and maxGram can also be final in EdgeNGramTokenFilter.java. I ve attached a new patch that includes these changes Ð all tests pass. Thanks Steven
