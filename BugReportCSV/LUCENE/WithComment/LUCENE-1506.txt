Adding FilteredDocIdSet and FilteredDocIdSetIterator
Adding 2 convenience classes FilteredDocIdSet and FilteredDocIDSetIterator. Can t this functionality be achieved via a normal Filter and ChainedFilter if you need to AND two Filters together Ie why introduce a new interface with the match method Filter calculates a DocSet given an IndexReader. Imagine a large index and the logic to calculate whether it is in the set is non-trivial so building this DocSet can be expensive. So in the case where the driving query produces a very small result set the validation can be performed only on the small set via the match call. Yes in terms of functionality one can do this with a filter but it is wasteful to perform the validation calculation on the entire index where the candidates to be in the hits set is small. OK I see. That is an important difference I think it makes sense to add this. Could you add javadocs a unit test Thanks John. sure will work on that. javadoc and unit test added Thanks John I made a few tweaks downgraded to Java 1.4 expanded javadocs fixed whitespace etc. . I think it s ready to commit. I ll wait a day or two. Thanks Michael Committed revision 740361. Thanks John
