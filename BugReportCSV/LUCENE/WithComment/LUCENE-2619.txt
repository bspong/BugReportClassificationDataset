simple improvements to tests
Simon had requested some docs on what all our test options do so lets clean it up and doc it. i propose change all vars to be tests.xxx e.g. tests.threadspercpu tests.multiplier ... ensure all 6 build systems lucene solr each solr contrib respect these. add a simple wiki page listing what these do. attach is an updated patch I completely disabled this solr dir.prop for tests as it doesn t work at all. In the first patch i tried to pass this like all other props args to all the tests for the contribs too. But this was being unconditionally set to in the core test macro itself so its completely useless. OK I committed these changes to trunk 988527 and 3x 988536 . I ll mark this resolved when the wiki page is done. OK initial wiki page is here http wiki.apache.org lucene-java RunningTests Thank you for adding the doc page Very much appreciated Simon Bulk close for 3.1
