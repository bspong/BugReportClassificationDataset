Cut over SpanQuery getSpans to AtomicReaderContext
Followup from LUCENE-2831 - SpanQuery getSpans IR seems to be the last remaining artifact that doesn t enforce per-segments context while it should really work on AtomicReaderContext SpanQuery getSpans AtomicReaderContext instead of a naked IR. here is a patch that cuts over to ARC and cleans up some of the tests to perform span operations per segment looks good to me thanks for splitting up the cleanup work from the other patch good idea. Seems like this is an easy one - I will commit shortly some more cleanups and CHANGES.TXT entry... will commit in a minute Committed revision 1062775.
