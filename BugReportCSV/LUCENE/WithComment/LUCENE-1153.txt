Lucene needs to ship the JUnit jar for testing
In order for Hudson builds etc. to work properly Lucene needs to ship the JUnit jar and have it made available in the testing classpath. Our system reqs say 3.8.1 but I have 3.8.2 laying around so I will update the system requirements too. Patch. Requires junit-3.8.2.jar in lib directory which is not included in the patch but I figure anyone testing it can easily find it I will commit later today. Committed revision 615329.
