Enable the use of NoMergePolicy and NoMergeScheduler by Benchmark
Benchmark allows one to set the MP and MS to use by defining the class name and then use reflection to instantiate them. However NoMP and NoMS are singletons and therefore reflection does not work for them. Easy fix in CreateIndexTask. I ll post a patch soon. Patch includes both fix to CreateIndexTask as well as relevant tests to CreateIndexTaskTest. I plan to commit later today if there are no objections. Patch looks good Shai Committed revision 931502. backport to 3.1 Committed revision 941448. Bulk close for 3.1
