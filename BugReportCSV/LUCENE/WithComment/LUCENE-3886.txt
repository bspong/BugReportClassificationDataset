MemoryIndex memory estimation in toString inconsistent with getMemorySize 
After LUCENE-3867 was committed there are some more minor problems with MemoryIndex s estimates. This patch will fix those and also add verbose test output of RAM needed for MemoryIndex vs. RAMDirectory. Interestingly the RAMDirectory always takes according to estimates so even with buffer overheads only 2 3 of the MemoryIndex excluding IndexReaders . Simple patch with cleanup. Will commit this soon to get 3.6 running. Committed trunk revision 1302709 Committed 3.x revision 1302717
