Remove synchronization in CompoundFileReader
Currently there is what seems to be unnecessary synchronization in CompoundFileReader. This is solved by cloning the base IndexInput. Synchronization in low level IO classes creates lock contention on highly multi threaded Lucene installations so much so that in many cases the CPU utilization never reaches the maximum without using something like ParallelMultiSearcher. This comment is very misleading. Since there is IO involved any operation can block which will lower CPU utilization. You just need to make sure that the locks control different physical resources. lucene-1322.patch CSIndexInput.clone added that clones the base IndexInput removing the synchronization overhead from CompoundFileReader.
