CharArraySet.clear 
I needed CharArraySet.clear for something I was working on in Solr in a tokenstream. instead I ended up using CharArrayMap Boolean because it supported .clear it would be better to use a set though currently it will throw UOE for .clear because AbstractSet will call iterator.remove which throws UOE. In Solr the very similar CharArrayMap.clear looks like this Override public void clear count 0 Arrays.fill keys null Arrays.fill values null I think we can do a similar thing as long as we throw UOE for the UnmodifiableCharArraySet will submit a patch later tonight unless someone is bored and has nothing better to do Patch for clear and modified test. The test already checks that the unmodifiable set cannot be cleared. patch looks good uwe 1 from my side I will commit this together with LUCENE-2169. For this to work in BW branch the clear test will be disabled. Committed revision 893655
