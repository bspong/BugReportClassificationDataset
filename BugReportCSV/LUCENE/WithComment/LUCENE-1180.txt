Syns2Index fails
Running Syns2Index fails with a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException maxBufferedDocs must at least be 2 when enabled exception. at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.setMaxBufferedDocs IndexWriter.java 883 at org.apache.lucene.wordnet.Syns2Index.index Syns2Index.java 249 at org.apache.lucene.wordnet.Syns2Index.main Syns2Index.java 208 The code is here blindly up these parameters for speed writer.setMergeFactor writer.getMergeFactor 2 writer.setMaxBufferedDocs writer.getMaxBufferedDocs 2 It looks like getMaxBufferedDocs used to return 10 and now it returns -1 not sure when that started happening. My suggestion would be to just remove these three lines. Since speed has already improved vastly there isn t a need to speed things up. To run this Syns2Index requires two args. The first is the location of the wn s.pl file and the second is the directory to create the index in. Thanks Jeffrey I agree with your assessment... could you provide a patch Patches to fix this for 2.3 and 2.4-dev It looks like Mike fixed this 2 months ago r694222 mikemccand 2008-09-11 08 11 03 -0400 Thu 11 Sep 2008 1 line fix wordnet s Syns2Index to not fiddle with mergeFactor maxBuffereDocs the latter was hitting an exception
