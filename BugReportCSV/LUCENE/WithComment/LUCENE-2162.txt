Based on the latest discussions in LUCENE-2039 this issue will expose the toplevel parser via the ExtensionQuery so that ExtensionParsers can access properties like getAllowLeadingWildcards from the top level parser. attached patch I plan to commit this until Dec. 28. If nobody objects. committed in revision 894180
