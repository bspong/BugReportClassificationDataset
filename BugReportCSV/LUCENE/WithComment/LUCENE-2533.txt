FileSwitchDirectory should uniqueify the String file names returned by listAll
Right now we blindly concatenate what s returned from primary secondary. But a legit use of FSD is pointing to the same underlying FSDir but w different impls for opening the inputs outputs. I have simple patch that just uniqueifies using Set String . reopening for possible 2.9.4 3.0.3 backport. I ll take this one its committing....
