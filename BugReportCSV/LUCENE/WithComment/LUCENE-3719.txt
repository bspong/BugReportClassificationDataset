FVH slow performance on very large queries
The change from HashSet to ArrayList for flatQueries in LUCENE-3019 resulted in very significant slowdown in some of our e-discovery queries after upgrade from 3.4.0 to 3.5.0. Our queries sometime contain tens of thousands of terms. As a result major portion of execution time for such queries is now spent in the flatQueries.contains sourceQuery method calls. The patch. trunk Committed revision 1237528. 3x Committed revision 1237531. Thanks Igor for reporting the issue and providing the patch
