RangeQuery equals method does not compare collator property fully
The equals method in the range query has the collator comparison implemented as this.collator null this.collator.equals other.collator When this.collator null and other.collator someCollator this method will incorrectly assume they are equal. So adding something like this.collator null other.collator null would fix the problem Thanks Mark
