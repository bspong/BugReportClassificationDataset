integrate snowball stopword lists
The snowball project creates stopword lists as well as stemmers example http svn.tartarus.org snowball trunk website algorithms english stop.txt view markup This patch includes the following snowball stopword lists for 13 languages in contrib snowball resources all stoplists are unmodified only added license header and converted each one from whatever encoding it was in to UTF-8 added getSnowballWordSet to WordListLoader this is because the format of these files is very different for example it supports multiple words per line and embedded comments. I did not add any changes to SnowballAnalyzer to actually automatically use these lists yet i would like us to discuss this in a future issue proposing integrating snowball with contrib analyzers. patch with mod to wordlistloader test and snowball stoplists for danish dutch english finnish french german hungarian italian norwegian russian spanish and swedish I will commit this in a few days if no one objects. Again i add the getSnowballWordSet to WordListLoader but if this is inappropriate we could instead have a SnowballWordListLoader in our snowball package or something doesn t matter to me. Robert patch looks good except of one thing. public static HashSet String getSnowballWordSet Reader reader it returns a hashset but should really return a Set String . We plan to change all return types to the interface instead of the implementation. thanks Simon I agree Committed revision 899955. Hi Robert when i changed the backwards tests i added a new param to svn exec task. With this patch it now behaves equal to bw checkouts If you have no svn.exe available it will ignore the checkout. If this is so the test should pass so I added an exit condition if the data dir is not available. If you have a svn.exe available but the checkout fails there is an network error or something else. The data dir now exists but the build should stop in this case. Sorry some whitespace issues. Fixed here. Committed Revision 900160
