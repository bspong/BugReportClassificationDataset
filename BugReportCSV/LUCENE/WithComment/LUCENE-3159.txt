lucene benchmark has some unnecessary files
lucene contrib benchmark .rsync-filter is only in the source pack and in SVN I was not aware of this file though it was added long ago in https issues.apache.org jira browse LUCENE-848 focusedCommentId 12491404 page com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels comment-tabpanel comment-12491404 Not a blocker for this RC just interesting to note. maybe this is related to LUCENE-3155 too in that we could consider this one for automatic exclusion like DS Store but we should fix it if its committed in SVN too. Committed revision 1129456 trunk 1129457 branch3x 1129458 branch32 See the discussion on LUCENE-3155 for why I don t think any more action is needed source packaging is an svn export the problem was that it was committed to svn. Bulk closing for 3.2
