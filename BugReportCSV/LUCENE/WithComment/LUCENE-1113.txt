fix for Document.getBoost documentation
The attached patch fixes the javadoc to make clear that getBoost will never return a useful value in most cases. I will commit this unless someone has a better wording or a real fix. How about Returns at indexing time the boost factor as set by link setBoost float . p Note that once a document is indexed this value is no longer available from the index. At search time for retrieved documents this method always returns 1. This however does not mean that the boost value set at indexing time was ignored - it was just combined with other indexing time factors and stored elsewhere for better indexing and search performance. For more info see the norm t d part of the scoring formula in link org.apache.lucene.search.Similarity Similarity . Thanks I ve committed your text.
