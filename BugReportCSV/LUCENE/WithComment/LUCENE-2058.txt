benchmark pkg specify trec eval submission output from the command line
the QueryDriver for the trec benchmark currently requires 4 command line arguments. the third argument is ignored i typically populate this with bogus Instead allow the third argument to specify the submission.txt file for trec eval. while I am here add a usage documenting what the arguments to this driver program do. if no one objects I would like to commit this to 3.0 I do not think it is a new feature just a cleanup. 1 the usage info is perfect goes to stderr and exits with 1 just like any other unix tool g I tested same results with these two patches as my old hackish setup. Committed revision 835674.
