Add private ctors to static utility classes
During development in 3.x and trunk we added some new classes like IOUtils and CodecUtils that are only providing static methods but have no ctor at all. This adds the default empty public ctor which is wrong the classes should never be instantiated. We should add private dummy ctors to prevent creating instances. Here are some of them I am sure there may be more such classes possibly outside util . When we backport to 3.x we should revalidate some classes existed before eg. BitUtil but they are all maked as lucene.internal so we may remove the ctors easily. Committed trunk revision 1030754 Committed 3.x revision 1030756 Bulk close for 3.1
