Remove unnecessary memory barriers in DWPT
Currently DWPT still uses AtomicLong to count the bytesUsed. Each write access issues an implicite memory barrier which is totally unnecessary since we doing everything single threaded on that level. This might be very minor but we shouldn t issue unnecessary memory barriers causing processors to lock their instruction pipeline for no reason. here is a patch that replaces the AtomicLong with a simple counter class that provides threadsafe and serial implementations. Looks good Simon Have you tested perf... Likely minor but you never know no I haven t tested perf yet I think I will just wait for the nightly benchmark here. I plan to commit this soon.
