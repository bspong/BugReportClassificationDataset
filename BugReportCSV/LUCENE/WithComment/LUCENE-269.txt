 PATCH demo HTML parser corrupts foreign characters
We are using HTML parser for parsing English and other NL documents in Eclipse. Post Lucene 1.2 there has been a regression in the parser. Characters coming from Reader obtained from getReader are corrupted. Only the characters that can be encoded using the default machine encoding go through correctly. For example parsing Chinese document on an English machine results with all characters except the few English words corrupted. Created an attachment id 12520 HTMLParser.jj.patch - simple fix for the problem. I applied your patch. Thanks a lot. I hadn t thought about this when changing HTMLParser a couple of months ago.
