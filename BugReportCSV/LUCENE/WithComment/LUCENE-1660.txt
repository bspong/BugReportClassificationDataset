Make StopFilter.enablePositionIncrements explicit
I think the default for this should be true ie do not lose information when filtering preserve the positions of the original tokens . But we can t change this without breaking back-compat. So as workaround we should make the parameter explicit so one must decide up front. Attached patch. I plan to commit in a day or two.
