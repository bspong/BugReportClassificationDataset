 PATCH don t delete all files in index directory on index creation
Many people use Lucene to index a part of their file system. The chance that you some day mix up index directory and document directory isn t that bad. Currently Lucene will delete all files in the index directory when the create paramater passed to IndexWriter is true thus deleting your documents if you mixed up the parameters. I ll attach a patch that fixes this. Any objections Created an attachment id 14887 patch to only delete known files in index directory Patch committed. Created an attachment id 14944 new patch with one place for suffixes 1 This looks great. Thanks.
