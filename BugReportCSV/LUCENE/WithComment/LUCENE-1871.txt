Highlighter wraps caching token filters that are not CachingTokenFilter in CachingTokenFilter
I figured this was fine and a rare case that you would have another caching tokenstream to feed the highlighter with - but I guess if its happening to you especially depending on what you are doing - its not an ideal situation. Allows you to take ownership of providing an efficiently resettable TokenStream for highlighting Are we also in feature freeze for contrib As this solution does not affect anything in Token only the highlighter we might commit this With consensus on my side I have no problem putting this in. I would like to have this in because there are other use-cases of this. Maybe one TokenStream chain is not caching on the top filter but maybe directly after the tokenizer and before the lowercase filter or something like that . In this case you would also add an additional caching to the top of the stream without really needing it. Because of this the marker-interface method would not do it too only something like isRewindable or isCachingTokens would do it if Filters pass it up to their input . So as far as one filter would cache tokens you could detect it even on the top stream. This is the same like the well-known InputStream usage if stream.markSupported stream new BufferedInputStream stream . markSupported of Filter streams also pass to their input. I have other places where it would be good to know if one stream supports reset for rewinding or rewind which I would prefer . We had this discussion on java-dev some time ago about decoupling rewinding from resetting a stream.
