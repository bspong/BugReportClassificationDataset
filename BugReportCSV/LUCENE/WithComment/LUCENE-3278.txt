Rename contrib queryparser project to queryparser-contrib
Much like with contrib queries we should differentiate the contrib queryparser from the queryparser module. No directory structure changes will be made just ant and maven. is there a more meaningful name then contrib While we are in the rename game maybe we should pick something that says something anything about what is different from the contrib query parser vs standard query parser. I m open to suggestions however the contrib actually contains a number of QueryParsers not just the flexible one and the contrib will be removed once I ve consolidated all the parsers into a module. With that in mind I do want to address the naming of the QPs when they are consolidated. They can t all be called QueryParser They can t all be called QueryParser Ya. The most important thing is that the various QueryParsers all have reasonable names Ð It looks like contrib is on its way out anyway Patch which changes project name and fixes maven dependencies.
