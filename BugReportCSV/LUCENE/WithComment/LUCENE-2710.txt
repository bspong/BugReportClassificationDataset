 reproduce with on test failure isn t right if you manually overrided anything
If you run a test with eg -Dtests.codec SimpleText... If it fails the reproduce with fails to include that manual override -Dtests.codec SimpleText ie it only includes the seed test class test method. So it won t actually reproduce the fail in general. We just need to fix the reproduce with to add any manual overrides.... here s a patch Works great for me 1 to commit. 1 Only If you use StringBuilder maybe use it to create the complete string reported upper part uses . But thats only tests so not important for perf just a general style question. I changed the s to stringbuilder appends Committed revision 1023250 1023256 3x Bulk close for 3.1
