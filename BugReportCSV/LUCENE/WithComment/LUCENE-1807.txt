Add convenient constructor to PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper for Dependency Injection
It would be good if PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper had a constructor which took in an analyzer map rather than having to repeatedly call addAnalyzer Ð this would make it much easier cleaner to use this class in e.g. Spring XML configurations. Relatively trivial change patch to be attached. Patch to add extra constructor. Makes sense and patch looks good... I ll commit shortly. Thanks Paul
