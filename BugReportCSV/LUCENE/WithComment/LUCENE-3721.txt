CharFilters not being invoked in Solr
On Solr trunk all CharFilters have been non-functional since LUCENE-3396 was committed in r1175297 on 25 Sept 2011 until Yonik s fix today in r1235810 Solr 3.x was not affected - CharFilters have been working there all along. According to the mailing thread this has nothing to do with htmlstripcharfilter. Robert does the attached test case work for you If not do you know how I can get it running the way it used to Also - I m happy to change the title if this isn t related to HTMLStripCharFilterFactory I m just seeing that the behavior we saw in Solr3.x is different with the same configuration in Solr4 - just trying to track down how we get it to work the way it used to Thanks for the help OK so it looks like all CharFilters were broken in Solr by LUCENE-3396 since last Sept . I just checked in a fix and added a test. Thanks for bringing this to our attention Mike I just checked in a fix and added a test. Mike s test succeeds for me with the fix. Thanks Yonik. I committed BasicFunctionalityTest.testHTMLStrip to branch 3x - it succeeds for me with no changes required. updated summary and description
