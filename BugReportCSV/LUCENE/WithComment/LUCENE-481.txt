IndexReader.getCurrentVersion and isCurrent should use commit lock.
There is a race condition if one machine is checking the current version of an index while another wants to update the segments file in IndexWriter.close . java.io.IOException Cannot delete segments at org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.renameFile FSDirectory.java 213 at org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos.write SegmentInfos.java 90 at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter 3.doBody IndexWriter.java 503 at org.apache.lucene.store.Lock With.run Lock.java 109 at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.mergeSegments IndexWriter.java 501 at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.flushRamSegments IndexWriter.java 440 at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.close IndexWriter.java 242 On the windows platform reading the contents of a file disallows deleting the file. I use Lucene to maintain an index of -700.000 documents one server adds documents while other servers handle the searches. The search servers poll the index version regularly to check if they have to reopen their IndexSearcher. Once in a while about once every two days on average IndexWriter.close fails because it cannot delete the previous segments file even though it hold the commit lock. The reason is probably that search servers are reading the segments file to check the version without using the commit lock. This should fix the problem. I didn t use the Lock.With helper class to avoid having to wrap the long or boolean result in a Long or Boolean first. The try ... finally block should be at least as clear to read as the Lock.With construct in this case... The problem is not limited to Windows Platforms The search servers also threw java.io.FileNotFoundException ... segments The system cannot find the file specified once every few days.... This is because the new segments data is first written to the file segments.new which is then renamed to segments . The javadoc for Directory says renameTo should be atomic but the current implementation in FSDirectory isn t. If the searcher happens to try to read the segments file in the admittedly very small time between the nu.delete and the old.renameTo nu it gets the FileNotFoundException Thanks Luc i ve commited this
