Lock.obtain timeout behaves incorrectly for large timeouts
Because timeout is a long but internal values derived from timeout are ints its possible to overflow those internal values into negative numbers and cause incorrect behavior. Spinoff from this thread http www.gossamer-threads.com lists lucene java-user 54376 Simple patch that fixes the bug. I also added static constant Lock.LOCK OBTAIN WAIT FOREVER which if passed as the timeout causes obtain to keep trying forever. Will commit in a day or two. I just committed this. Thanks Nikolay
