fix more position corrumptions in 4.0 codecs
Spinoff of LUCENE-3876. Some codecs have invalid asserts wrong shift operators etc. If a position exceeds Integer.MAX VALUE 2 and then also has a payload it will produce corrumpt indexes or other strange errors. Easiest way to trigger the bugs is to sometimes add a payload to the test from LUCENE-3876. initial cut at a patch some bugs in Sep and Pulsing. Didn t run the test enough times to ensure all codecs are fixed yet. I ran the test many times found one more invalid assert in MockSingleIntBlock. This is ready to go. I ll backport the test improvement to 3.x
