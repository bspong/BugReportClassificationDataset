Surround query language
This is a copy of what I posted about a year ago. The whole thing is hereby licenced under the Apache Licence 2.0 copyright 2005 Apache Software Foundation. For inclusion in Lucene sandbox perhaps it will need at least the following adaptations renaming of package names org.surround to somewhere org.apache.lucene moves of the source files to corresponding directories Although it uses the identifier sncf in some places I m not associated with French railroads but I like the TGV. Regards Paul Elschot Created an attachment id 14633 surround-0.1.tgz tarred zip of the sources Created an attachment id 15196 Surround query language for contrib surround The tests again with some expected standard ouput. A little bit of deprecation is left in the CharStream getLine and getColumn in the parser. The build.xml is stand alone with constants for the Êenvironment. It was derived from a lucene build.xml of a few eons ago so I hope someone can still integrate it... The ant targets are clean javacc compile test Regards Paul Elschot The Surround tests still pass with the recent fix in SpanTermQuery. This was expected because Surround does not use SpanTermQuery directly as a subquery of a BooleanQuery. Regards Paul Elschot I m starting integration of this into contrib surround. Thank you very much for this great contribution I have committed it to contrib surround. There may still need to be some tweaks to the build process to get it to fit into the mould of the contrib area so please re-open and attach any adjustments that need to be made or let me know and I can take care of some minor tweaks.
