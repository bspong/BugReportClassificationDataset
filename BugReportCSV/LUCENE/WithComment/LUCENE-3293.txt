Use IOContext.READONCE in VarGapTermsIndexReader to load FST
VarGapTermsIndexReader should pass READONCE context down when it opens reads the FST. Yet it should just replace the ctx passed in ie if we are merging vs reading we want to differentiate. Also edited SegmentReader loadLiveDocs varun patch looks good. I think you don t need to assign a new variable each time but pass the new IOContext directly. Can you please add javadoc comments to the new constructor to explain what it does I don t understand your assert in the get method in the patch. can you explain Added javadoc to the new ctor in IOContext and also made the other changes. looks good I think this is ready to commit though. thoughts anyone Patch looks good Just add a space after the in new IOContext context true in VariableGapTermsIndexReader.java committed to trunk in revision 1145755 thanks varun
