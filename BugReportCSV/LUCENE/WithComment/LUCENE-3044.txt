thaiwordfilter uses attributesource.copyTo incorrectly
The bug can be seen by https builds.apache.org hudson job Lucene-Solr-tests-only-3.x 7367 It looks like the issue is this lazy initialization of the cloned token if the tokenstream is reused and the consumer is interested in a different set of attributes it could be a problem. one probably-probably-not-totally-correct fix would be to add clonedToken null to reset at least it would solve this case Yeah fix is correct for this TokenFilter. It should loose all state on reset here s a patch i added an explicit test for this also. 1 thats the easiest to solve this. Committed revisions 1096334 1096337 3x Bulk closing for 3.2
