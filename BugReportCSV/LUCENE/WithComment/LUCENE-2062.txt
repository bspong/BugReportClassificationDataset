Bulgarian Analyzer
someone asked about bulgarian analysis on solr-user today... http www.lucidimagination.com search document e1e7a5636edb1db2 non english languages I was surprised we did not have anything. This analyzer implements the algorithm specified here http members.unine.ch jacques.savoy Papers BUIR.pdf In the measurements there this improves MAP approx 34 some improvements on the previous patch mostly changing the test to work in a similar way to TestCzechStemmer refining stopwords list javadocs etc. I think this one is ready. I ll commit in a few days if no one objects. Hi if someone has a couple moments to double-check this patch I appreciate it. I know I need to add a stopwords reference to NOTICE.txt since its BSD I think everything is in order but maybe I forgot something it would make me feel better before committing. I updated the patch to the current trunk and added some final keywords here and there. IMO BulgarianStemmer should be final but that is not much of a deal. We might do that with all the stemmers to be consistent. the stemmer looks good to me - all test pass ... and forgot the resource part. sorry about that Simon thanks here is patch with NOTICE etc. If no one objects I will commit it tomorrow. If no one objects I will commit it tomorrow. 1 - looked over and ran tests as well - looks great to me. Thanks for reviewing Mark. btw there are some comments in the tests I think this algorithm is too conservative in some places specifically the length constraints . But I don t have the test collection to verify that modifying these won t destroy relevance so I prefer sticking with the published algorithm. Committed revision 886190. Thanks for the reviews and assistance
