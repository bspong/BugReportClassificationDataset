Mark Fieldable as allowing some changes in 2.x future releases
See http lucene.markmail.org message 4k2gqs3n7coh4lmd q Fieldable 1. We mark Fieldable as being subject to change. We heavily advertise on java-dev and java-user and maybe general that in the next minor release of Lucene 2.4 Fieldable will be changing. It is also marked at the top of CHANGES.txt very clearly for all the world to see. Since 2.4 is probably at least a month away I think this gives anyone with a pulse enough time to react. Draft. Looks good Grant. Maybe cancel out the double-negative in It will however not mean that a new version of the Lucene can t read an old version within the same major version. to something like this rough draft This change only affects the Fieldable API other backwards compatibility promises remain intact. For example Lucene can still read and write indices created within the same major version. Committed revision 682689.
