Add log.step support per task
Following LUCENE-1774 this will add support for log.step per task name rather than a single log.step setting for all tasks. The .alg file will support log.step - for all tasks. log.step. Task Class Name - for a specific task. For example log.step.AddDoc or log.step.DeleteDoc I will post the patch soon PerfTask changes a test case. All benchmark tests pass. I changed the delete log step in the existing algs to match the new format and I updated the package.html to be a bit more correct in terms of log.step. That should be good enough for this issue but I think we do also have to reconcile the package.html documentation with some of the more recent changes. Its not horribly off but its off and their are some tasks it doesn t list. Relating to this issue it also still mentions doc.tokenize.log.step which is no longer used. Not fixed in my patch but should this now be log.step.ReadTokens I m not sure offhand what used to use that log name. Thanks Mark updating the existing .alg files slipped my mind. I ll look at the package.html tomorrow and update it where relevant. Updated package.html to describe the latest ContentSource DocMaker changes added some tasks description and updated the logging section. Mark - I deleted the doc.tokenize.log.step line since it referred to ReadTokensTask which you can now set by log.step.ReadTokens. Since we document log.step. class above it I saw no reason to keep it there. thanks shai
