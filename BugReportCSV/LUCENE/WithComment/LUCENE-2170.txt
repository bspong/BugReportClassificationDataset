Thread starvation problems in some tests
In some of the tests a time limit is set and the tests have a while inTime loop. If creation of thread under heavy load is too slow the tasks are not done. Most tests are only useful if the task is at least done once most would even fail . This thread changes the loops to be do...while so the task is run at least one time. Patch that fixes this issue. I will port to backwards too. This patch also fixes incorrect multi-threaded use of a boolean variable. I made it volatile. Ugh Looks good Uwe. Thanks Patch for bw branch. I will commit soon. If we want to enable builds of 3.0 or 2.9 branch on hudson we must backport this. small update in patches while loop . Committed revision 892216
