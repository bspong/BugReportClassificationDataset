create a simple test that indexes and searches byte terms
Currently the only good test that does this is Test2BTerms disabled by default I think we should test this capability and also have a simpler example for how to do this. attached is a first patch... maybe Uwe won t be able to resist rewriting it to make it simpler one thing i did previously seemed overkill but maybe good to do was to clearAttributes setBytesRef on each incrementToken more like a normal tokenizer. we could still change it to work like this. in this case clear set the br to null. another thing to inspect is the reflection api so toString prints the bytes... didnt check this. Reflection should work correct. No need to change anything. 1 Ð this is a great test to add now that we support arbitrary binary terms. Committed revision 1124288.
