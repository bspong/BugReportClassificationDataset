Add IndexReader.flush commitUserData 
IndexWriter offers a commit String commitUserData method. IndexReader can commit as well using the flush close methods and so needs an analogous method that accepts commitUserData. All tests pass. Added IndexReader.flush userCommitData . I m hesitant about adding IR.close userCommitData as IndexWriter.close doesn t have a similar method. I tweaked the patch to keep back compat we can t just change IndexReader s protected doCommit method . I think it s ready to commit... I ll wait a day or two. Committed revision 748493. Thanks Jason This patch fixes deprecation errors I wrote a class extends FilterIndexReader. This class produced on compilation an deprecation warning on doCommit without any hint to this method in my code I did not implement doCommit nor used the method . It seems that javac from 1.5 needs the deprecation also in the subclasses. With this patch applied the own subclass did not produce the warning anymore. OK I just committed that thanks Uwe.
