DEFAULT spelled DEFALT in MoreLikeThis.java
DEFAULT is spelled DEFALT in contrib queries src java org apache lucene search similar MoreLikeThis.java http svn.osafoundation.org pylucene trunk patches.lucene contains a patch among others to fix this. Thanks this has been fixed. I renamed the var and as it s documented in CHANGES.txt I don t think it s necessary to keep the old var and deprecate it. Yes you fixed it in one place but this file is actually duplicated in the Lucene source tree. The bug I filed was about the other occurrence in the queries contrib module since it seems to be the one that is current as implied in the queries module readme.txt file. contrib queries src java org apache lucene search similar MoreLikeThis.java is still wrong. Okay unless there s a third version of that file it s fixed now Closing all issues that were resolved for 2.1.
