If you pass Integer.MAX VALUE as 2nd param to search Query int you hit unexpected NegativeArraySizeException
Note that this is a nonsense value to pass in since our PQ impl allocates the array up front. It s because PQ takes 1 this value which wraps to -1 and attempts to allocate that. We should bounds check it and drop PQ size by one in this case. Better maybe in IndexSearcher if that n is ever maxDoc set it to maxDoc . This trips users up fairly often because they assume our PQ doesn t statically pre-allocate a reasonable assumption... . Patch attached. In PQ if incoming size is Integer.MAX VALUE I don t try to 1 it. And in IndexSearcher.search when I create PQ I now use min nDocs maxDoc . I ll commit shortly. Thanks Paul backport
