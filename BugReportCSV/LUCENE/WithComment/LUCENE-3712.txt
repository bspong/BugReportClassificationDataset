Remove unused and untested methods from ReaderUtil that are also veeeeery ineffective
ReaderUtil contains two methods that are nowhere used and not even tested. Additionally those are implemented with useless List- array copying ineffective docStart calculation for a binary search later instead directly returning the reader while scanning Ð and I am not sure if they really work as expected. As ReaderUtil is lucene.internal we should remove them in 3.x and trunk alternatively the useless array copy docStarts handling should be removed and tests added public static IndexReader subReader int doc IndexReader reader public static IndexReader subReader IndexReader reader int subIndex 1 untested and unused nuke it. Committed trunk revision 1235228 Committed 3.x revision 1235234
