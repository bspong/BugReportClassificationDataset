Add tests.iter.min to improve controlling tests.iter s behavior
As discussed here http lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com Stop-iterating-if-testsFailed-td2747426.html this issue proposes to add tests.iter.min in order to allow one better control over how many iterations are run Keep tests.iter as it is today Add tests.iter.min default to tests.iter to denote that at least N instances of the test should run until there s either a failure or tests.iter is reached. If one wants to run until the first failure he can set tests.iter.min 1 and tests.iter X Ð up to X instances of the test will run until the first failure. Similarly one can set tests.iter N to denote that at least N instances should run regardless if there were failures but if after N runs a failure occurred the test should stop. Note unlike what s proposed on the thread tests.iter.max is dropped from this proposal as it s exactly like tests.iter so no point in having two similar parameters. I will work on a patch tomorrow. Patch 3x adds tests.iter.min which allows stop iterating if at least N instances ran and there was a failure. The last failed iteration is printed. Since it s a trivial change I plan to commit this either later today or tomorrow. I took a glance looks good to me Committed revision 1087033 3x . Committed revision 1087036 trunk . Bulk closing for 3.2
