Add getVersion method to IndexCommit
Returns the equivalent of IndexReader.getVersion for IndexCommit public abstract long getVersion Probably best to add getGeneration method Are you suggesting instead or in addition to getVersion getGeneration in addition. Will IndexCommit.getVersion return the same value as the IndexReader that created it I m using this in conjunction with IndexReader to close an object associated with the IndexReader upon deletion of the snapshot. OK I ll do both. Yes getVersion will be the same as IndexReader.getVersion if that reader was opened on the same commit point. Attached patch. I plan to commit in a day or two.
