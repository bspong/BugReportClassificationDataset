wrong stats scoring from MemoryCodec
I hit some random failures in the flexscoring branch wierd because its not a random test. I noticed the test always failed with memorycodec and wrote a specific test for it. I haven t traced thru it yet but I think its likely the issue that memorycodec is somehow returning wrong stats here patch with a test goes against the flex scoring branch. the issue only happens with omitTF my guess is that its returning something strange for totalTermFreq... will try to make a better test. patch for trunk. I committed this no problems with any other codecs. Phew nice catch SimpleText had this issue too... i had not run the tests enough we intentionally return SimpleText less often
