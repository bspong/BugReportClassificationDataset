make it easier to access default stopwords for language analyzers
DM Smith made the following comment sometimes it is hard to dig out the stop set from the analyzers Looking around some of these analyzers have very different ways of storing the default list. One idea is to consider generalizing something like what Simon did with LUCENE-1965 LUCENE-1962 and having all stopwords lists stored as .txt files in resources folder. Returns an unmodifiable instance of the default stop-words set. return an unmodifiable instance of the default stop-words set. public static Set String getDefaultStopSet Thanks Robert for bringing this up in a general context. I will take care of it soon. Simon can i close this I think you have fixed it with LUCENE-2034 incorporated in LUCENE-2034
