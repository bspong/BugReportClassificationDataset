Remove deprecated charset support from Greek and Russian analyzers
This removes the deprecated support for custom charsets. One thing I found is that once these charsets are removed RussianLowerCaseFilter is the same as LowerCaseFilter. So I marked it deprecated to be removed in 3.1 I d like to commit this in a few days if there are no objections. I don t want to conflict with StringBuffer - StringBuilder work in LUCENE-1257. I think its pretty straightforward and all the backwards compat is preserved in any new code. Just commit it The StringBuilder stuff is simple I also changed some of them already. TortoiseMerge is fine with merging such simple change. Committed revision 820756.
