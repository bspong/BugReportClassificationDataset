Changes.html not explicitly included in release
None of the release related ant targets explicitly call cahnges-to-html ... this seems like an oversight. currently it s only called as part of the nightly target I m sick of dealing with forrest. this patch does the following things... calls cahnges-to-html from the pacakge target add a link to Changes.html and Contrib-Changes.html in the left nav of the version specific docs fixes a hardcoded link to the public site when refering to the contrib changes in an existing page. it has the side effect of of causing forrest to freak out that it doesn t know how to create Changes.html ... never mind that i ve configured it to be an external page never mind that there are 100 other external pages configured the same way that work just fine all of the contrib javadoc pages ... forrest refuses to play nice with me. I ve taken this as far as i can ... someone else can pick it up if they choose. Thanks - Steve orig hardcoded that link and I made it relative - then realized it didn t work cause changes.html didn t go out in dist - just thought that was on purpose - so went back to hardcoded. Much better this way. This patch fixes the Forrest issue. cli.xconf how many years have i been using forrest w o knowing about this file Patch looks good so far mark ... go for it. Maybe Main should be changed to be the conventional Core the standard term when differentiating from Contrib in the new Changes menu agreed ... the only reason i had Main in my patch is because i thought maybe the Core link in the javadocs menu was causing the problem so i tried a unique name. Patch looks good so far mark ... go for it. scratch that mark ... you ve got enough on your plate i ll finish this r812734
