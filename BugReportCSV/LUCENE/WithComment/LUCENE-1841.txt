Provide Summary Information on the Files in the Lucene index
I find myself often having to remember by file extension what is in a particular index file. The information is all contained in the File Formats but not summarized. This patch provides a simple table that describes the extensions and provides links to the relevant section. Grant this is helpful. nit i noticed typo offest in the tvx section Committed revision 806916.
