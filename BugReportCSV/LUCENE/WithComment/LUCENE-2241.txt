Core Tests should call Version based ctors instead of deprecated default ctors
LUCENE-2183 introduced new ctors for all CharTokenizer subclasses. Core - tests should use those ctors with Version.LUCENE CURRENT instead of the the deprecated ctors. Yet LUCENE-2240 introduces more Version ctors For WhitespaceAnalyzer and SimpleAnalyzer. Test should also use their Version ctors instead the default ones. this is block by LUCENE-2240 converted all core tests to use Version ctors Patch looks good I will commit this with LUCENE-2240 in a day or two. Committed revision 905044 Thanks Simon
