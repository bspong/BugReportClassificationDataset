Support SortedSource in MultiDocValues
MultiDocValues doesn t support Sorted variant ie. SortedSource but throws UnsupportedOperationException. This forces users to work per segment. For consistency we should support sortedsource also if we wrap the DocValues in MDV. here is a patch that merges multiple SortedSources on the fly using in MultiDocValues. This allows to use SlowMRW etc. even with sorted DocValue variants. I cut back to use SlowMRW if needed in TestSort and TestTypePromotion and added a testcase to TestDocValuesIndexing to assert sorting etc. I also generalized SortedBytesMergeUtils and used it in MultiDocValues to implement the on-the-fly merging. all tests pass yay I will commit this if nobody objects
