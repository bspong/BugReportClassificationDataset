small SentinelIntSet can cause infinite loop on resize
A small initial size of 4 can cause the set to not rehash soon enough and thus go into an infinite loop searching the table for an open space. Martijn brought this to my attention and I committed a fix test to trunk. But via IRC 16 46 yonik mvg is there anything in a released version of Lucene Solr that uses SentinelIntSet in a way that causes it to resize 16 47 yonik if not no CHANGES entry needed... 16 48 mvg Yes in the TermAllGroupsCollector and in some impl of TermAllGroupHeadsCollector 16 49 mvg Both collectors can take an initial size. 16 49 mvg The SentinelIntSet can grow in these collectors. The default on those collectors is 128 so most likely no one was bit i.e. they would need to override that default but we should add a CHANGES entry and backport to 3x.
