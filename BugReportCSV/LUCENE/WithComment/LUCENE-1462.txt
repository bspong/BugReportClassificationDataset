Instantiated IndexWriter discrepanies
RAMDirectory seems to do a reset on tokenStreams the first time this permits to initialise some objects before starting streaming InstantiatedIndex does not. I can Serialize a RAMDirectory but I cannot on a InstantiatedIndex because of java.io.NotSerializableException org.apache.lucene.index.TermVectorOffsetInfo http www.nabble.com InstatiatedIndex-questions-to20576722.html Made a few classes implement java.io Serializable TestCase that makes sure InstantiatedIndex can be passed to an ObjectOutputStream Added a tokenStream.reset in InstantiatedIndexWriter I need help to get this committed as it contains a minor change to TermVectorOffsetInfo implements Serializable thats outside of the contrib module. Karl I made TVOI serializable Committed revision 724501. Committed in r726030 and r 725837.
