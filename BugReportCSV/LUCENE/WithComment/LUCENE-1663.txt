Documentation bug. The 2.4.1 query parser syntax wiki page says it is for 1.9
This page http lucene.apache.org java 2 4 1 queryparsersyntax.html says this .bq This page provides the Query Parser syntax in Lucene 1.9. If you are using a different version of Lucene please consult the copy of docs queryparsersyntax.html that was distributed with the version you are using. This is misleading on a doc page for 2.4.1 Good catch I ll fix. Does anyone know in Forrest how to refer to the current version Else I ll reword that paragraph to generically refer to the current version ...
