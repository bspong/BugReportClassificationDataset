thread pool implementation of parallel queries
This component is a replacement for ParallelMultiQuery that runs a thread pool with queue instead of starting threads for every query execution so its performance is better . Created an attachment id 16054 ConcurrentMultiSearcher.java The implementation which still lacks a solution for the method that accepts a HitCollector . It seems likely that HitCollectors wouldn t expect concurrent calls and would end up breaking. It might be an idea to add a extension interface to imply the thread awareness then test for the extension in the method. You can provide an ExecutorService now so I think this one is resolved.
