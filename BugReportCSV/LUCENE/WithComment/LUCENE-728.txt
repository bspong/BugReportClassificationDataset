Remove or deprecate contrib similarity
Classes under contrib similarity seem to be duplicates of classes under contrib queries. I d like to remove .java from contrib similarity without bothering with deprecation since the same functionality exists in contrib queries. Anyone minds Finito. No more contrib similarity .java until people contribute new custom Similarity implementations which we could then put under contrib similarity.
