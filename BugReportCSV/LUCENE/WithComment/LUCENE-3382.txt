fix compound-file NoSuchDirectoryException bugs in NRTCachingDir
found some bugs over on LUCENE-3374 but we should fix these separately from whether or not we move it to core and the bugs apply to 3.x too. here we can just add explicit tests for the problems. here s a patch with specific tests. I am committing soon. This is fixed NRTCachingDir uses DefaultCompoundFileDirectory always to ensure that the .cfe file is handled correctly. I will now write the same tests for FileSwitchDirectory
