lazily create SegmentMergeInfo.docMap
Since creating the docMap is expensive and it s only used during segment merging not searching defer creation until it is requested. SegmentMergeInfo is also used in MultiTermEnum the term enumerator for a MultiReader. TermEnum is used by queries such as PrefixQuery RangeQuery WildcardQuery as well as RangeFilter DateFilter and sorting the first time filling the FieldCache . Performance Results A simple single field index with 555 555 documents and 1000 random deletions was queried 1000 times with a PrefixQuery matching a single document. Performance Before Patch indexing time 121 656 ms querying time 58 812 ms Performance After Patch indexing time 121 000 ms querying time 598 ms A 100 fold increase in query performance All lucene unit tests pass. attaching patch Also deferred creation of SegmentMergeInfo.postings TermPositions for another 15 gain. Same index and query were used to test but this time 100 000 query iterations. defer docMap only indexing time 121 734 ms querying time 18 266 ms defer docMap and postings indexing time 120 860 ms querying time 15 625 ms
