Make FSIndexInput and FSIndexOutput inner classes of FSDirectory
I would like make FSIndexInput and FSIndexOutput protected static inner classes of FSDirectory. Currently these classes are located in the same source file as FSDirectory which means that classes outside the store package can not extend them. I don t see any performance impacts or other side effects of this trivial patch. All unit tests pass. Attaching the patch file. If nobody objects I m going to commit this soon. Heh. These classes precede the addition of nested classes to Java. They re nine years old 1 Funny I didn t even know that nested classes weren t in Java forever... I just committed this.
