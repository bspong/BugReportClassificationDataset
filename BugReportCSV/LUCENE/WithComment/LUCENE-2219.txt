improve BaseTokenStreamTestCase to test end 
If offsetAtt end is not implemented correctly then there can be problems with highlighting see LUCENE-2207 for an example with CJKTokenizer. In my opinion you currently have to write too much code to test this. This patch does the following adds optional Integer finalOffset can be null for no checking to assertTokenStreamContents in assertAnalyzesTo automatically fill this with the String length In my opinion this is correct for assertTokenStreamContents the behavior should be optional it may not even have a Tokenizer. If you are using assertTokenStreamContents with a Tokenizer then simply provide the extra expected value to check it. for assertAnalyzesTo then it is implied there is a tokenizer so it should be checked. the tests pass for core but there are failures in contrib even besides CJKTokenizer apply Koji s patch from LUCENE-2207 it is correct . Specifically ChineseTokenizer has a similar problem. this fixes contrib too as long as you apply the CJKTokenizer fix from LUCENE-2207. end was incorrect for ChineseTokenizer SmartChinese and Wikipedia Wikipedia does not call super.end . Looks good Wikipedia does not call super.end . Uwe thanks for taking a look... even StandardTokenizer does not call super.end should we really do this i merged Koji s fix and tests to CJK from LUCENE-2207 into this patch and improved CJKTokenizer s tests to always use assertAnalyzesTo for better checking. i plan to commit soon I am fine with this patch Committed revision 900196 to trunk.
