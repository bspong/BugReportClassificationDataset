Jar manifest should not contain user.name of the person building
Not sure if it is a big deal but I don t particularly like that my user id for my build machine is in the manifest of the JAR that I constructed. It s a stretch security-wise I know but I don t see how it serves any useful purpose. We have signatures logs SVN tags so we know who built the particular item w o needing to know what their local user account name is. The fix is Index common-build.xml common-build.xml revision 661027 common-build.xml working copy -281 7 281 7 attribute name Implementation-Title value org.apache.lucene impl version can be any string attribute name Implementation-Version - value version svnversion - user.name - DSTAMP TSTAMP value version svnversion - DSTAMP TSTAMP attribute name Implementation-Vendor value The Apache Software Foundation attribute name X-Compile-Source-JDK FWIW I included it originally because i ve definitely seen value in the past when you can look at an artifact and ask who built this where did it come from ... maybe not so much for official releases but i ve been in enough positions where organizations build their own artifacts from source and later you want to know who built it so you can double check with them how they did it because you think they screwed something up I believe maven actually forcibly puts the build user in every manifest file so it s not like we were in bleeding edge territory or anything. I too always felt this a feature albeit a minor one.
