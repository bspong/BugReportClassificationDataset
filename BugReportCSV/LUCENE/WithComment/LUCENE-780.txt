Generalize directory copy operation
The copy operation in RAMDirectory Directory constructor can be used more generally to copy one directory to another. Why bound it only to RAMDirectory . For example I build index in RAMDirectory but I need it to persist in FSDirectory. I created a patch to solve it. I agree moving this up to Directory from RAMDirectory makes sense. The patch applies cleanly and all tests pass. I will make a small change to do the is.close os.close in a finally clause and then I ll commit it. Thanks Jiri OK I committed this. I added the try finally and made some small changes to the javadoc. Thanks Jiri and keep the patches coming Closing all issues that were resolved for 2.1.
