random analyzer tests
we have been finding fixing lots of bugs by randomizing lucene tests. in r966878 I added a variant of random unicode string that gives you a random string within the same unicode block for other purposes I think we should use this to test the analyzers better for example we should pound tons of random greek strings against the greek analyzer and at least make sure there aren t exceptions. here s a patch this test already found an attributes bug LUCENE-3042 and I found a bug in the german stemmer the one that used to be used by default before lucene 3.1 . I ll open a separate bug for that one I Ignored it here because I want to get the tests in. Committed revisions 1096178 1096186 Bulk closing for 3.2
