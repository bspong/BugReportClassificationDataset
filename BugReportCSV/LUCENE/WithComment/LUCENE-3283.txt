Move core QueryParsers to queryparser module
Move the contents of lucene src java org apache lucene queryParser to the queryparser module. To differentiate these parsers from the others they are going to be placed a classic package. We ll rename QueryParser to ClassicQueryParser as well. Patch which creates the queryparser module moves the core QueryParsers into the classic package updates dependencies throughout the code. Code will compile in intellij but not ant eclipse or maven just yet. Pending Fix ant dependencies in modules which depend on the queryparser module Add eclipse and maven support for new module. Move javacc building stuff into queryparser build.xml Update migrate.txt Command for patch svn parents mkdir modules queryparser src java org apache lucene queryparser classic svn parents mkdir modules queryparser src test org apache lucene queryparser classic svn move lucene src java org apache lucene queryParser modules queryparser src java org apache lucene queryparser classic svn move lucene src test org apache lucene queryParser modules queryparser src test org apache lucene queryparser classic New patch ant dependencies are fixed eclipse and maven support added javacc building support moved to queryparser build.xml untested Everything compiles and test pass. I ll verify that the javacc building works while I wait for anybody to review. Javacc support works. Command to clean up left over directories svn delete lucene src java org apache lucene queryParser svn delete lucene src test org apache lucene queryParser New patch which fixes javadoc errors introduced. Also includes MIGRATE.txt change. At the completion of the queryparser consolidations I m going to open an issue to look at all the documentation in the codebase since alot of it refers to QueryParser. New patch updated to trunk. I m seeing some unrelated test failures on trunk so I m going to wait for those to be resolved before committing this large change.

Was this LUCENE-3303 or is there something else Just that one thanks Mike Committed revision 1145016. I m going to rename this QueryParser to ClassicQueryParser in a separate issue.
