 PATCH HTMLParser doesn t parse hexadecimal character references
I recently inherited a project from an ex-colleague it uses Lucene and in particular the HTML Parser. I ve found that she had made an amendment to the parser to allow it to parse and decode hexadecimal character references which we depend on but had not reported a bug. If she had someone might have pointed out that her correction was wrong ... I don t seem to be able to attach the fairly trivial patch to an initial bug report and in any case I ve failed to find the instructions for generating a diff file in the right format even though I m sure I ve seen it somewhere . Now that the report exists you can add an attachment with the Create a new attachment link. You can build the diff with diff -u oldfile newfile or just cvs diff -u file if you have checked out Lucene from CVS. Created an attachment id 12405 patch to allow HTMLParser to recognise hexadecimal character references Corrected version to 1.4 Bug 30621 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. Also see 30621 for a longer description. Thanks I just committed your patch.
