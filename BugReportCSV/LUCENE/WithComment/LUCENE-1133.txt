WikipediaTokenizer needs a way of not tokenizing certain parts of the text
It would be nice if the WikipediaTokenizer had a way of via a flag leaving categories links etc. as single tokens or at least some parts of them Thus if we came across Category My Big Idea there would be a way of outputting as a single token My Big Idea . Optionally it would be good to output both My Big Idea and the individual tokens as well. I am not sure of how to do this in JFlex so any insight would be appreciated. I d actually love the option to skip that stuff all together. The last time I checked one Wikipedia dump Croatian not English text pointers in angle bracket was really junk at lest for my purposes of getting a representative list of tokens and types for a language. I use a TokenFilter to decide what to with the links Aha. Which existing one Custom Custom. Here s a completely back-compatible if there is such a thing for something that hasn t been released patch that allows for 3 different output options 1. Tokens only the current functionality 2. Untokenized only 3. Both In case 2 a Set of Wiki types is passed in and any token that has that type will not be tokenized. Case 3 is the combination of 1 and 2 with the untokenized token output first. See the unit test for how it should work. I will commit after the release pending improvements etc. Here s a patch that also includes LUCENE-1137 and sets a flag for the untokenized token when BOTH or UNTOKENIZED ONLY is the output type. This patch is an alternative to the existing one and doesn t necessarily have to replace that one it just demonstrates using 1137 for something fun. Committed on 614895
