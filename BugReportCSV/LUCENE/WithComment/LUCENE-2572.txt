Maven artifacts for Lucene 4 are not stored in the correct path
Hello I would like to use the maven artifacts for Lucene 4.0 produced by the Hudson build machine. The artifacts are correctly produced http hudson.zones.apache.org hudson view Lucene job Lucene-trunk lastSuccessfulBuild artifact maven artifacts lucene . However the artifacts which should be stored under the path org apache lucene are currently stored under lucene which prevents a project using maven to correctly download the Lucene 4.0 artifacts. Thanks again for your help. Committed change to hudson build scripts revision 1060628 and 1060630
