Calls to SegmentInfos.message should be wrapped w infoStream null checks
To avoid the expensive message creation which involves the operator on strings calls to message should be wrapped w infoStream null check rather than inside message . I ll attach a patch which does that. Patch w the proposed changes. Can someone plz help me commit this The change is really simple. Shai which version did you generate the patch on I hit one odd hunk failure in applying the patch to trunk because your version doesn t have an if exc null check... Are you talking about this if exc null infoStream null It used to be if exc null message And I changed it to if exc null infoStream null message Or is it something else Anyway according to the patch it s on rev. 917047 Woops sorry my bad Ð I just wasn t up to date. T sall good... I ll commit shortly. Phew .. I was wondering if using words like trivial and simple in issues jinxes them Thanks Shai
