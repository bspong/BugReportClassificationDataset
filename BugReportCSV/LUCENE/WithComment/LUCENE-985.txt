AIOOB thrown when length of termText is longer than 16384 characters ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 
DocumentsWriter has a max term length of 16384 if you cross that you get an unfriendly ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. We should fix to raise a clearer exception. As a clarification point for people who stumble upon this issue years from now after encountering whatever exception we put in place of the current one... why is there a max termText length making summary longer to improve searchability of the exception for other people who may get bit by it As a clarification point for people who stumble upon this issue years from now after encountering whatever exception we put in place of the current one...why is there a max termText length This is because DocumentsWriter packs the term text for each unique term seen into a pool of char blocks of 16384 chars each to avoid GC overhead of each separate String . So every time a new term is seen it puts it at the end of the current block when there s not enough space it allocates another block from the pool. So a given term must fit entirely into a single block. I doubt anyone will have a problem with the limit. And if they hit the exception it is probably due to bad end-user input of some kind. I always run a token filter that leaves out any token larger than 250 charachters or so depending on the application. It was quite accidential that I hit this AIOOBE. That would also be a recommendation I think makes sense in the documentation people will look up when hitting the exception. I doubt anyone will have a problem with the limit.

I ve added a blurb in javadoc for IndexWriter.addDocument explaining this limit. Thanks for catching this Karl
