GData - Server wrong commit does not build
The last GData - Server commit does not build due to a wrong commit. Yonik did not commit all the files in the diff file. There are several sources and packages missing. The diff - file with the date of 26.06.06 should be applied. http issues.apache.org jira browse LUCENE-598 26.06.06.diff 644 kb could any of the lucene committers apply this patch. Yonik is on the way to Dublin. Thanks Simon I attempted to revert yonik s changes using svn merge -r 417265 417264 . and then readd the requiredLibs.tar.gz and apply your 26.06.06.diff ... but even then there were 3 compilation errors in the test stemming from this missing class... javac symbol class StorageModifierStub javac location package org.apache.lucene.gdata.storage.lucenestorage javac import org.apache.lucene.gdata.storage.lucenestorage.StorageModifierStub ...perhaps the best way to proceed would be for you to submit a new clean patch against the currently broken HEAD New created clean patch to the current brocken head. Thanks hossman for your help Patch committed. NOTE even with this patch some tests error on my system... chrish asimov svn lucene-bugs lucene java trunk build contrib gdata-server test egrep -hr errors failures 0 . testsuite errors 2 failures 0 name org.apache.lucene.gdata.storage.lucenestorage.TestStorageModifier tests 9 time 1.261
