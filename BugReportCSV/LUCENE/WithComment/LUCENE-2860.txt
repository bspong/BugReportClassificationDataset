SegmentInfo.sizeInBytes ignore includeDocStore when caching
I noticed that SegmentInfo s sizeInBytes cache is potentially buggy Ð it doesn t take into account includeDocStores . I.e. if you call it once w false sizeInBytes won t include the store files and then with true or vice versa you won t get the right sizeInBytes it won t re-compute with the store files . I ll fix and add a test case demonstrating the bug. Patch fixes the bug and adds test case. Ugh my bad Thanks Shai. Patch looks good. Committed revision 1058147 3x . Committed revision 1058155 trunk . Bulk close for 3.1
