Use a System.arraycopy more than a for
In org.apache.lucene.index.DocumentWriter. The patch will explain by itself. I didn t make any performance test but I think it is obvious that it will be faster. All tests passed. About the priority of the issue I didn t want to set it to Major I just forget to set it correctly. Thanks for the patch OK it looks like you re replacing two cases in DocumentWriter.java where we are manually copying arrays with for loops with calls to System.arraycopy instead. This patch applies cleanly the unit tests pass. I will commit this. Committed Thanks Nicolas Ð keep the patches coming Closing all issues that were resolved for 2.1.
