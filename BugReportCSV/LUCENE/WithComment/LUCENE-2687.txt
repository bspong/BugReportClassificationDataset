Remove Priority-Queue size trap in MultiTermQuery.TopTermsBooleanQueryRewrite
These APIs are new in 3.x so we can do this with no backwards-compatibility issue Before 3.1 FuzzyQuery had its own internal rewrite method. We exposed this in 3.x as TopTermsBooleanQueryRewrite and then as subclasses for Scoring and Boost-only variants. The problem I have is that the PQ has a default large size of Integer.MAX VALUE... of course its later limited by the value of BooleanQuery s maxClauseCount but I think this is a trap. Instead its better to simply remove these defaults and force the user to provide a default reasonable size. all tests pass with the fix. Committed revision 1005310 1005312 3x Bulk close for 3.1
