Contrib query org.apache.lucene.search.BoostingQuery sets boost on constructor Query not cloned copy
BoostingQuery sets the boost value on the passed context Query public BoostingQuery Query match Query context float boost this.match match this.context Query context.clone clone before boost this.boost boost context.setBoost 0.0f ignore context-only matches This should be this.context.setBoost 0.0f ignore context-only matches Also boost value of 0.0 may have wrong effect - see discussion at http www.mail-archive.com java-user lucene.apache.org msg12243.html Thanks for pointing this bug out Antony. Please ignore my earlier suggestion that setting the boost to zero might be undesirable. I tested the code and it is correct with this fix.
