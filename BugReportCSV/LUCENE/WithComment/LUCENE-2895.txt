MockRandomCodec loads termsIndex even if termsIndexDivisor is set to -1
When working on LUCENE-2891 on trunk I found out that if MockRandomCodec is used then setting IWC.readerTermsIndexDivisor to -1 allows seeking e.g. termDocs when it shouldn t. Other Codecs fail to seek as expected by the test. We need to find out why MockRandomCodec does not fail as expected. To verify that run ant test-core -Dtestcase TestIndexWriterReader -Dtestmethod testNoTermsIndex -Dtests.codec MockRandom but comment out the line which adds MockRandom to the list of illegal codecs in the test. MockRandom randomly set termsIndexDivisor. Changed it to set it only if it s not already -1 in which case we know someone specifically asked not to load the terms index such as the test . Patch includes the fix in MockRandomCodec and removes MockRandom from the set of illegal codecs. Committed revision 1064463.
