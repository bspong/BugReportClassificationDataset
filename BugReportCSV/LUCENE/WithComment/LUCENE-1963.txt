ArabicAnalyzer Lowercase before Stopfilter
ArabicAnalyzer lowercases text in case you have some non-Arabic text around. It also allows you to set a custom stopword list you might augment the Arabic list with some English ones for example . In this case its helpful for these non-Arabic stopwords to lowercase before stopfilter. simple patch but will need to warn in CHANGES.txt that folks should reindex if they are using non-Arabic stopwords. if no one objects I d like to commit this for 3.0 at the end of the day. here also update the javadocs to reflect the new order of what is going on in ArabicAnalyzer to prevent any confusion to users. can you commit it to 2.9.1 too For those stuck on Java 1.4 there is no 3.0 . can you commit it to 2.9.1 too For those stuck on Java 1.4 there is no 3.0 . can someone comment on this one for me. I don t think its too much of a stretch to consider this a bug even if it does not affect Arabic text. Committed revision 823534. if it is ok to apply this to 2.9 branch as DM requested we should reopen Your issue - if you can stretch it to bugish territory I d 1 it. I d be wary of getting into porting features to 2.9.1 - but I wouldn t have a problem with this one myself. Mark I think the problem is really that I overlooked this use case in LUCENE-1758 because Arabic is not case sensitive. It won t affect the default usage of the Analyzer where all the stopwords are in Arabic and lowercase is a no-op . I am going to also set fix for 2.9.1 and give a day or two for people to comment if they disagree with applying to 2.9 branch. its been a few days no one objected to applying this fix to the branch. but I do not have permissions to commit to the branch... can someone commit this for me Attached is the patch. Committed on 2.9.x. Thanks Robert Bulk close all 2.9.1 issues.
