TieredMergePolicy should expose control over how aggressively segments with deletions are targeted
TMP today always does a linear pro-rating of a merge s score according to what pctg of the documents are deleted I d like to 1 put a power factor in score is multiplicative and 2 default it to stronger favoring of merging away deletions. Good idea... 1 for a power factor above 1. Simple patch adding setReclaimDeletesWeight to TMP and defaulting it to 2.0. I also fixed LTC.newTieredMergePolicy to randomly set this... Great idea I was thinking about that when I wrote the reply about no need to optimize in java-user bulk close for 3.3
