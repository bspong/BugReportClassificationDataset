Demo and contrib jars should contain NOTICE.TXT and LICENSE.TXT
We should include NOTICE.TXT and LICENSE.TXT not only in the core jar but also in the demo and contrib jars. With this patch the two files are included in the META-INF dir of the demo jar the demo war and the contrib jars. I will commit this soon. Committed.
