contrib benchmark tests fail find data dirs
This was exposed by LUCENE-940 - a test was added that uses the Reuters collection. Then tests succeed when ran from contrib benchmark e.g. by IDE but fail when running as part of ant test-contrib because the test expects to find the Reuters data under trunk work. To resolve this add work.dir property to Config to be set to the value of system property benchmark.work.dir with default work . in common-build.xml define this new property as common.dir contrib benchmark work in all doc makers refer to config.get work.dir rather than current hard-coded . work . mark this as blocking LUCENE-940 because the tests added there will continue to fail when running as part of ant test-contrib until this one is resolved. Patch solving this issue. tested - all tests pass. Will commit this soon because currently automated builds are broken. committed and now the parabuild test passed... phew
