reorder arguments of Field constructor to be more intuitive
I think Field should take name value type not name type value This seems more intuitive and consistent with previous releases Take this change to some code I had for example - d1.add new Field foo bar Field.Store.YES Field.Index.ANALYZED d1.add new Field foo TextField.TYPE STORED bar I think it would be better if it was document.add new Field foo bar TextField.TYPE STORED 1 we should minimize the change on upgrade as much as we can. Patch which reorders the arguments. ahhh sweet i m guessing you have an IDE that does this If the tests pass commit this kinda crap goes out of date too fast Yeah IntelliJ - Change Signature refactor. Committed revision 1176773. Also updated MIGRATE.txt Awesome thanks Chris
