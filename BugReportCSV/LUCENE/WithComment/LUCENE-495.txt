Suggested Patches to MultiPhraseQuery and QueryTermExtractor for use with HighLighter 
I encountered a problem with the Highlighter where it was not recognizing MultiPhraseQuery. To fix this I developed the following two patches 1. Addition to org.apache.lucene.search.MultiPhraseQuery Add the following method Returns the set of terms in this phrase. public Term getTerms ArrayList allTerms new ArrayList Iterator iterator termArrays.iterator while iterator.hasNext Term terms Term iterator.next for int i 0 n terms.length i n i allTerms.add terms i return Term allTerms.toArray new Term 0 2. Patch to org.apache.lucene.search.highlight.QueryTermExtractor a Add the following import import org.apache.lucene.search.MultiPhraseQuery b Add the following code to the end of the getTerms ... method else if query instanceof MultiPhraseQuery getTermsFromMultiPhraseQuery MultiPhraseQuery query terms fieldName c Add the following method private static final void getTermsFromMultiPhraseQuery MultiPhraseQuery query HashSet terms String fieldName Term queryTerms query.getTerms int i for i 0 i queryTerms.length i if fieldName null queryTerms i .field fieldName terms.add new WeightedTerm query.getBoost queryTerms i .text Can the team update the repository Thanks Michael Harhen if you could post a test case or a patch to an existing test case that demonstrates the error in the existing code and shows that your patch fixes that bug thats one of the best ways to encourage that a patch get applied. Both the span and standard Highlighters have support for MultiPhraseQuery at this point.
