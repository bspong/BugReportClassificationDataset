ConcurrentScheduleManager.addMyself has wrong inted
This method has the wrong index for the size variable I think it should b allInstances.size. private void addMyself synchronized allInstances final int size 0 int upto 0 for int i 0 i size i final ConcurrentMergeScheduler other ConcurrentMergeScheduler allInstances.get i if other.closed 0 other.mergeThreadCount Keep this one for now it still has threads or may spawn new threads allInstances.set upto other allInstances.subList upto allInstances.size .clear allInstances.add this Good catch thanks Scott I ll commit shortly. This is only used by unit tests to ensure that a test fails whenever ConcurrentMergeScheduler hits an unhandled exception.
