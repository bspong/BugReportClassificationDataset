Incorrect error message in AnalyzingQueryParser.getPrefixQuery
The error message of getPrefixQuery is incorrect when tokens were added for example by a stemmer. The message is token was consumed even if tokens were added. Attached is a patch which when applied gives a better description of what actually happened. Patch for current trunk. Committed. Thanks Ronnie
