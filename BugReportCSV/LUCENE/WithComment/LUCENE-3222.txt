Buffered deletes under count RAM
I found this while working on LUCENE-2548 when we freeze the deletes create FrozenBufferedDeletes when we set the bytesUsed we are failing to account for RAM required for the term bytes and now term field . Simple patch I ll commit shortly backport. bulk close for 3.3
