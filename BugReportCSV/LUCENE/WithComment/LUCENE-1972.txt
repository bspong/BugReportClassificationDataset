Remove deprecated ExtendedFieldCache and Auto Custom caches and lot s of deprecated sort logic
Remove deprecated ExtendedFieldCache and Auto Custom caches and sort This patch removes ExtendedFieldCache bw layer. It also removes the AUTO and CUSTOM caches. Because of that also lot s of SortField logic was also changed and deprecations removed not yet complete HitCollector is still there . But with this patch most of the deprecated sort logic is removed old Collectors old sorting collectors legacy search ... I also converted the Sort ctors setSort methods to varargs and changed the tests. It s now easier to use. Will commit when all tests were run again and nobody complains. This patch may miss to remove some dead code but this should be done later when the inventors of the new Search API look closer over it. Committed revision 824699 Some small additional deprecated removals after finishing the rest. Will commit now. Committed revision 824792 Attached is the patch committed in 3.0 branch and trunk rev 893104 that fixes the accidental remove of SortField.getComparatorSource . Thanks John Wang
