SweetSpotSimiliarity
This is a new Similarity implimention for the contrib miscellaneous package it provides a Similiarty designed for people who know the sweetspot of their data. three major pieces of functionality are included 1 a lengthNorm which creates a platuea of values. 2 a baseline tf that provides a fixed value for tf s up to a minimum at which point it becomes a sqrt curve this is used by the tf int function. 3 a hyperbolic tf function which is best explained by graphing the equation. this isn t used by default but is available for subclasses to call from their own tf functions. All constants used in all functions are configurable. In the case of lengthNorm the constants are configurable per field as well as allowing for defaults for unspecified fields. patch file containing class and test cases Commited with some small changes mainly adding Apache Copyright License and switching the default value of tf hyper base to 1.3d the old default of Math.E is typically used in hyperbolic tangents but made little sense in the context of a tf function
