Fix SnowballAnalyzer casing behavior for Turkish Language
LUCENE-2102 added a new TokenFilter to handle Turkish unique casing behavior correctly. We should fix the casing behavior in SnowballAnalyzer too as it supports a TurkishStemmer. patch for the bug that for Turkish language when Version 3.1 use TurkishLowerCaseFilter instead in SnowballAnalyzer Add javadoc note to SnowballFilter noting that it expects lowercased text to work and in the turkish case you must use the special filter add contrib analyzers dependency to contrib snowball perhaps not the best but what is the other option Robert the patch looks almost good. You should also change the pom.xml.template to reflect the new dependency. I m still thinking about moving snowball into analyzers as a analyzers snowball would that make sense Somewhat unrelated but still ugly Class stemClass Class.forName org.tartarus.snowball.ext. name Stemmer When I look through the patch I see this name parameter which is used to load a stemmer per reflection. We should really define a factory interface that creates the stemmer and get rid of the refelction code this patch includes update to pom.xml.template I m still thinking about moving snowball into analyzers as a analyzers snowball would that make sense we have to do something about the duplication LUCENE-2055 . There i have suggested we upload the snowball stoplists which are nice so that we can get rid of some hand-coded java functionality. It is silly to have the exact same Russian stemmer in two different places in contrib etc. then we have open issues like LUCENE-559... Robert Patch looks good and all tests pass. I plan to commit this later tomorrow if nobody objects. I will commit shortly if nobody objects committed in revision 888787 thanks robert
