In modules analysys icu ant gennorm2 does not work
Command to run gennorm2 does not work at present. Also icupkg needs to be called to convert the binary file to big-endian. I will attach a patch. Just a build.xml tweak. I included a couple of extra tests for the ICUFoldingFilter on the basis that more tests can t hurt. perfect now the file can be easily regenerated... i just tested. i noticed for whatever strange reason the delete didnt delete the utr30.tmp but i ll figure it out Thanks a lot Oops I just noticed also that the tmpfile was not getting deleted. A stupid typo gennorm.tmp instead of gennorm2.tmp . Here s a fixed patch. And by the way I tested that it is OK to run icupkg on the file even if it is already big-endian. I find it a strange concept to have two binary file formats one for big-endian and one for little-endian only one of which is usable. I would have thought that the gennorm2 program should generate the file format that works no matter what machine it is run on. No doubt there are complex reasons for this design weirdness. I know that sadly some people have to still deal with EBCDIC. Thanks David that did the trick I made one small change just in case something goes wrong it uses build.dir for the temp file. I d like to commit this soon to trunk and 3x. I find it a strange concept to have two binary file formats one for big-endian and one for little-endian only one of which is usable. I would have thought that the gennorm2 program should generate the file format that works no matter what machine it is run on. I could be wrong but I think the reason ICU s data files are endian-dependent is because they are designed to be very very quickly mapped into memory e.g. the speed at which the underlying character property data can be mapped into memory so that java.lang.Character becomes useful is sensitive Committed revision 991053 trunk 991055 3x Thanks David Bulk close for 3.1
