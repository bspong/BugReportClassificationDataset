            <title>[JCR-2386] wrong eval order of access control entries within a single node (node-based ac)</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-2386</link>
                <project id="10591" key="JCR">Jackrabbit Content Repository</project>
                        <description>it seems to me that with the node-based access control the ac entries within a given node are currently collected in the wrong order.&lt;br/&gt;
if i remember correctly this worked before and i removed at some point (for reasons i don&amp;#39;t recall exactly but have the vague idea that it&lt;br/&gt;
was related to the allow-only for groups).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
anyway:&lt;br/&gt;
while playing around with the permission in our CRX recently i found, that the evaluation of the following setup didn&amp;#39;t work as I would&lt;br/&gt;
have expected:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
- user A is member of group B and C&lt;br/&gt;
- for both groups an ACE exists on a given node /a/b/c&lt;br/&gt;
- the acl looks like  { deny for B, allow for C }&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I would have expected that the allow for C would have reverted the previous deny for B since - in the GUI - I read the ace eval order from first entry to last entry... in the order I added them.</description>
