                        <description>Implement basic clustering, i.e. make two or more repositories available at the same time,  allowing them to stay in sync with changes applied to only one of them.</description>

&lt;br/&gt;
Features still missing:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
- Automatic archival of journal log entries to save space&lt;br/&gt;
- Using a database as backend for the journal</comment>
                    <comment id="12447786" author="ianeboston" created="Tue, 7 Nov 2006 13:29:56 +0000"  >Question.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Does this feature include the situation where there are 3 or more nodes all writing to Jackrabbit.... or is it the use case where there is one master jackrabbit and a number of slave (read-only) jackrabbits ?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
My understnading of &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-169&quot; title=&quot;Make Jackrabbit clusterable&quot;&gt;&lt;strike&gt;JCR-169&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was that it was asking for the former (is all writable).... but not a problem if this wont address that aspect.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks</comment>

&lt;br/&gt;
Couple of questions:&lt;br/&gt;
1) Is the search index in other clusters also synced up if each cluster has the index in its local disk? Or is it required to have the search index  in a common file system?&lt;br/&gt;
2) Are the other clusters updated immediately? For example, if one cluster adds a new node, is it immediately visible to other sessions in other clusters, as is mandated by the JCR spec?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks&lt;br/&gt;

I therefore changed the default file-based journal implementation to append records to one file until its size has passed some limit. Verified that this works&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Fixed in revision 473383.</comment>

The basic clustering stuff is in, so I suggest to resolve this issue as Fixed (Fix version 1.2) and file new issues for any specific problems that still may remain or come up.</comment>

                    <comment id="12454688" author="mikepkp17" created="Thu, 30 Nov 2006 16:15:36 +0000"  >We did some tests with 3 clusternodes. We had problems with the following use case:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
JBoss-4.0.5-GA with latest JCA and latest Jackrabbit. Only Jackrabbit is configured for clustering, JBoss is running standalone on each clusternode.&lt;br/&gt;
All 3 clusternodes already have several jcr-nodes and an existing index-folder.&lt;br/&gt;
2 nodes are running, the third node is stopped. Added a jcr-node on clusternode A, the new jcr-node is immediately visible on clusternode B (after a browser refresh of course).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Then I start clusternode C which boots up normaly. I then load my testapp. Consoleoutput shows, that all jcr-nodes are loaded except the one added on clusternode A. It just stopps working there, I don&amp;#39;t get an exception and no response in the browser window. If I delete the index-folder in the local workspace folder everything works fine.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So I suppose that item changes are not properly merged into existing index if a clusternode was down.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t had the time yet to dig into this.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Maybe someone can confirm this behavior with another configuration?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I will file a new jira issue if I know more about this...</comment>
