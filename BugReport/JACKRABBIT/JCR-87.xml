collections was refactored between 2.x and 3.x and many classes were moved to new packages. If you think it&amp;#39;s worth the change, I volunteer to update the imports.</comment>
                    <comment id="62030" author="jukkaz" created="Sun, 3 Apr 2005 00:44:32 +0100"  >Is there some added benefit in upgrading? AFAIK you should be able to just replace the commons-collections 2.1 jar with a newer jar in the classpath if you want to use newer features (commons-collections should mostly be backwards compatible).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As long as Jackrabbit only specifies the build dependencies and not the runtime dependencies, I see this issue as a &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t break it if it works&amp;quot; case. :-)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
But if you think that upgrading the dependency and possibly using the refactored classes would be beneficial also to the Jackrabbit internals, then I see no problem in accepting the change.&lt;br/&gt;

There are many more features in 3.x that will be available to jackrabbit internals. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; AFAIK you should be able to just replace the commons-collections &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; 2.1 jar with a newer jar in the classpath &lt;br/&gt;
yes, 3.x is backward compatible but 4.x won&amp;#39;t be. I think it&amp;#39;s not an important issue now because as you pointed developers can use a newer version without breaking things.  I have no strong position on this as long as the newer versions don&amp;#39;t break things, that&amp;#39;s why I created this issue as a minor wish :)</comment>
                    <comment id="62164" author="jukkaz" created="Tue, 5 Apr 2005 19:27:42 +0100"  >OK, sounds reasonable. Unless anyone objects within a week or two, I think I can upgrade the dependency.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For reference, a quick summary of the differences between commons-collections versions:&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
PS. There should be no hurry to update runtime environments that still have commons-collections 2.1 as a dependency. Such an update becomes necessary only if (or when) new features of 3.1 become used in Jackrabbit.</comment>
