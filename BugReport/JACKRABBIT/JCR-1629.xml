                        <description>now that people start writing SPI implementations we should provide a test-suite that runs on the SPI directly in order to provide the developers a way to assert basic compliance of their implementation without having the JCR api in between.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
my initial idea was to add tests for the SPI interfaces to the jackrabbit-spi project.&lt;br/&gt;
while it seems feasible to have the tests packed to a separated jackrabbit-spi-VERSION-tests.jar&lt;br/&gt;
by defining the goal: test-jar with the maven-jar-plugin, i didn&amp;#39;t manage to make usage of that tests-jar-file&lt;br/&gt;
for the tests of a SPI implementation such as jackrabbit-spi2jcr.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
unless someone knows, how to do that, i would therefore suggest to create a &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; new project jackrabbit-spi-tests &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
that similar to the jackrabbit-jcr-tests contains test-cases below src/main&lt;br/&gt;
instead of src/test and allow to be added as separated dependency to any SPI implementation&lt;br/&gt;
project.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

                    <comment id="12600776" author="anchela" created="Thu, 29 May 2008 15:24:27 +0100"  >&amp;gt; What features would this component test for that jcr-tests + jcr2spi don&amp;#39;t already cover? &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
it would include tests running directly on the SPI interfaces. neither jcr-tests nor the tests present with jcr2spi cover that, which means that any implementor of the SPI interfaces can only indirectly test the implementation, which can be quite cumbersome.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
second we could move the generic SPI test-cases that are currently present in the spi-commons project and provide them for other implementations.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
third we had a place to put SPI related tests that arise from questions posted to the dev/user-list and from the various discussions mostly related to missing javadoc.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
as stated above: if there is another way to achieve that, i&amp;#39;m perfectly happy with another approach as well.&lt;br/&gt;
but i think that starting to build tests for the SPI would be valuable.</comment>

Using the jackrabbit-jcr2spi test for a specific spi implementation is problematic since it has dependencies on the existing spi implementations (i.e. spi2jcr). What we need here is a way to run the jackrabbit-jcr2spi tests for an arbitrary spi implementation without introducing alien dependencies.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Overall we need a mechanism for a spi implementation to run the jackrabbit-jcr2spi test and the (to be written or not) jackrabbit-spi tests.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
agreed. but this is yet another issue or at least an extension to the original goal of this issue.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
anyway. i will attach patches that attempt to provide&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
- basic setup that allows to write tests against the SPI interfaces (located in the jackrabbit-spi project)&lt;br/&gt;
- clean jcr2spi from dependency to jackrabbit-spi2jcr and jackrabbit-core&lt;br/&gt;
- add test-jar goal for both &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt; jackrabbit-jcr2spi and  &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt; jackrabbit-spi&lt;br/&gt;
- jackrabbit-spi2jcr: run jcr2spi-tests and spi-tests by adding extra dependencies with the &amp;#39;tests&amp;#39; classifier. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
it worked for me (this time)... but i&amp;#39;m not totally convinced that this part of the maven functionality really works reliably.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
please comment&lt;br/&gt;

if nobody objects for whatever reason, i will commit the patches within the next days.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
for the record: as far as i know this maven feature that has not yet been used within the jackrabbit project. this make it looks a bit suspect to me; despite the fact, that the project builds ;)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
if anybody had bad experiences with the &amp;#39;tests&amp;#39; classifier, please let me know.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
- AbstractSPITest.java serves as base test class&lt;br/&gt;
- configuration file can be extended for additional tests</comment>
