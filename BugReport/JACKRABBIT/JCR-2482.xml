My opinion is that it just obfuscates the code, without helping. Similar to adding &amp;#39;final&amp;#39; everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;
To ensure the code is correct, you anyway need automated tests.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not saying that the commit should be rolled back, just wondering what others think.&lt;br/&gt;
I would favor disabling the compiler warning for missing @Override.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
For the @Override it helps the compiler ensure correct extension. It is much simpler fixing issues occurring at compile time than to write tests and try to find issues at test/run time. Second it helps identifying overwritten methods when looking at the source without an IDE, e.g. by just skimming SVN with a browser.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For final: It serves AFAICT two purposes. One it helps preventing overwriting values inadvertedly, thus going into the &amp;quot;find bugs at compile time&amp;quot; category as the @Override annotation. The other use it might help compilers and vms optimizie the variable (though this may be of less importance nowadays with advanced compilers and modern VMs).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So, I think it is a good thing to have them.</comment>

&lt;br/&gt;
Having too many @Override&amp;#39;s around can actually be a good sign of a potential target for refactoring (composition over inheritance).</comment>
                    <comment id="12829025" author="mduerig" created="Wed, 3 Feb 2010 11:09:41 +0000"  >If a super class (probably due to a library upgrade) removes a method which your code overrides, without @Override your code will compile fine, just your method won&amp;#39;t get called anymore. This may lead to very subtle and probably hard to find bugs. With @Override your code wont compile anymore immediately directing you to the problem. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I think the clutter of @Override is very low compared to the value added. &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
i&amp;#39;m very happy with the changes made by michael and i consider this kind of minor code improvements&lt;br/&gt;
and cleanups as very valuable. the @Override lines never bothered me and they actually are a reasonable&lt;br/&gt;
replacement for my @see xzw-method comments that i tried to add consistently in order to force the ide&lt;br/&gt;
to inform me about changes made to super-classes such as michael pointed out above [yes, i use to have &lt;br/&gt;
javadoc problems reported as error] </comment>
