&lt;br/&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t see a problem as long as it&amp;#39;s clear what is testing functionality (.api) and what is testing performance (.performance),&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
I very much welcome that we create performance tests but they *must not* be located in jackrabbit-jcr-tests.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
-1, for including this in jackrabbit-jcr-tests&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
So, how about a jackrabbit-perf-tests, depending on the existing test for setup/config/etc?&lt;br/&gt;

performance testing is a different story than testing JCR functionality, isn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;br/&gt;

                    <comment id="12573705" author="mreutegg" created="Fri, 29 Feb 2008 12:19:24 +0000"  >&amp;gt; So, how about a jackrabbit-perf-tests, depending on the existing test for setup/config/etc? &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please do so.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
From my point of view, there shouldn&amp;#39;t be any setup/config stuff in the  jackrabbit-performance-tests. Setting up tests is done in jackrabbit-core, which means we just have to add a new test dependency to jackrabbit-core to include the performance tests and a probably a test class similar to org.apache.jackrabbit.core.integration.JCRAPITest.</comment>

&lt;br/&gt;
1) How about a name like jackrabbit-benchmark or jackrabbit-jcr-benchmark? That would indicate a bit larger scope for the component. The package name would be org.apache.jackrabbit.benchmark.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
2) It would be nice if we could move the while loop into an abstract base class or even to the test framework.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
3) How about a more structured performance report instead of just logging the numbers? I&amp;#39;d like to automate the generation of some kind of a trend graph.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We can take care of 2 and 3 also later on.</comment>

                    <comment id="12575311" author="reschke" created="Wed, 5 Mar 2008 11:36:12 +0000"  >&amp;gt; 1) How about a name like jackrabbit-benchmark or jackrabbit-jcr-benchmark? That would indicate a bit larger scope for the component. The package name would be org.apache.jackrabbit.benchmark. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Yep. I&amp;#39;ll make it &amp;quot;jackrabbit-jcr-benchmark&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; 2) It would be nice if we could move the while loop into an abstract base class or even to the test framework.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; 3) How about a more structured performance report instead of just logging the numbers? I&amp;#39;d like to automate the generation of some kind of a trend graph. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I would prefer to delay stuff like that until we have more test cases and we see patterns emerging.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; Also, instead of the TestAll class, it might be more useful to have something like a PerformanceSuite class that can be instantiated and added to the test suites of downstream components like jackrabbit-core.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Yes, I&amp;#39;ll do that.</comment>

I would use jackrabbit-benchmark for the package name, since it&amp;#39;s not JCR (API) related.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Marcel: I was following the pattern in jackrabbit-jcr-tests; anything wrong with that?&lt;br/&gt;

                    <comment id="12575364" author="jukkaz" created="Wed, 5 Mar 2008 14:31:55 +0000"  >+1 Feel free to commit it, it&amp;#39;s easier to tweak the details in svn.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Esteban: The idea is to keep these tests free of Jackrabbit-specific functionality, so that we could run the benchmark on various different JCR implementations.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Marcel: Agreed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
BTW, why is the explicit concurrent:concurrent dependency needed?</comment>

&lt;br/&gt;
The dependence to concurrent isn&amp;#39;t needed (copied &amp;amp; pasted too much).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;m removing TestAll.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Commit coming soon.&lt;br/&gt;
