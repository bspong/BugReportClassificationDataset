                    <comment id="12725657" author="simonw" created="Tue, 30 Jun 2009 16:00:11 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Robert, I had a look at this patch - good work! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you planing to add more javadoc fixes to it, I found a couple of inline comment being still chinese in&lt;br/&gt;
BigramDictionary.java&lt;br/&gt;
BiSegGraph.java&lt;br/&gt;
HHMMSegmenter.java&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and real javadoc in &lt;br/&gt;
WordDictionary.java&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think we could remove the commented source code in &lt;br/&gt;
SegToken.java&lt;br/&gt;
SegTokenPair.java&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as well as the logger code in &lt;br/&gt;
WordDictionary.java&lt;/p&gt;

                    <comment id="12725737" author="rcmuir" created="Tue, 30 Jun 2009 19:33:45 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Simon you are right, I only did the public scope javadoc (and some of the comments). I thought this was most important for now, since it would be what the users see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you are correct there are some package/private/protected javadocs that i didn&apos;t get to.&lt;br/&gt;
there are also main methods, commented out test code as you mentioned.&lt;br/&gt;
finally, basically all the classes are in public scope, and many internal-only classes should instead be package protected (imho). This might involve reorganizing the files a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you want me to do these things as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="12725771" author="simonw" created="Tue, 30 Jun 2009 20:53:41 +0100"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought this was most important for now, since it would be what the users see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree, those are most important. I really appreciate this doc work, again thanks for that. I would like to have this in for 2.9 preferably with all chinese documentation replaced. Would be greate if you could do it! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;all the classes are in public scope, and many internal-only classes should instead be package protected (imho). This might involve reorganizing the files a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;agreement again. I would rather do that in a second patch / issue as soon as this one is commited. Would this remove some of the addtional documentation work? If so you can leave those as they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;simon&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="12725778" author="rcmuir" created="Tue, 30 Jun 2009 21:07:20 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Simon, I believe fixing the scope issues would reduce the documentation work considerably. For many of the classes that really should not be public, there is still a lot of missing documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, things such as Utility class and everything in .hhmm package should be package-protected. I already wasted time partially javadocing these things, which probably wasn&apos;t a complete waste, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you look it over, I think you can see I put much more effort into the main analyzer/tokenizer classes that should be public. So these docs are of higher-quality because I think both users and lucene developers will need to interact with these (such as porting to the new Token api, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think in the short term, I like this patch as is because I think developers will be able to port it to the new API and users will be able to understand what it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can come back around later and do a more thorough job, but this isn&apos;t the only analyzer that needs some documentation improvements!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Yeah those could be cleaned up quite a bit. Lets do this in a different patch / issue after this one is commited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think in the short term, I like this patch as is because I think developers will be able to port it to the new API and users will be able to understand what it does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets get it in, it is a huge improvement to the Chinese documentation and needed too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can come back around later and do a more thorough job, but this isn&apos;t the only analyzer that needs some documentation improvements!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the attitude!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <comment id="12726053" author="rcmuir" created="Wed, 1 Jul 2009 14:26:26 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Simon, thanks. It was mentioned on the mailing list that perhaps this analyzer might be moved in the future (since the datafiles cause analyzers.jar to be very large).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, maybe at the same time when/if this is done the files could be reorganized in a way that allows a lot of these internal classes to be marked package private.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="12726146" author="simonw" created="Wed, 1 Jul 2009 18:39:42 +0100"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was mentioned on the mailing list that perhaps this analyzer might be moved in the future (since the datafiles cause analyzers.jar to be very large). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a new issue for this - &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1728&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot;&gt;LUCENE-1728&lt;/a&gt; feel free to grab it.&lt;/p&gt;
