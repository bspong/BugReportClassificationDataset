            <title>[LUCENE-930] fail build if contrib tests fail to compile</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-930</link>
                <project id="12310110" key="LUCENE">Lucene - Core</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;spinoff of &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-885&quot; title=&quot;clean up build files so contrib tests are run more easily&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;LUCENE-885&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from Steven&apos;s comments...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the current build (r545324) it looks like the some contrib failures are getting swallowed. Things like lucli are throwing errors along the lines of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;subant&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; /home/barronpark/smparkes/work/lucene/trunk/common-build.xml:366: srcdir &quot;/home/barronpark/smparkes/work/lucene/trunk/contrib/lucli/src/test&quot; does not exist!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but these don&apos;t make it back up to the top level status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like the current state will bubble up junit failures, but maybe not build failures?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s &quot;test-compile-contrib&quot; (if you will) that fails and rather being contrib-crawled, that&apos;s only done as the target of &quot;test&quot; in each contrib directory, at which point, it&apos;s running in the protected contrib-crawl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy enough to lift this loop into another target, e.g., build-contrib-test. And that will start surfacing errors, which I can work through.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="12502957" author="hossman" created="Fri, 8 Jun 2007 23:39:59 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Damn, i forgot to include these comments from Steven regarding the patch...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patch file removes the swallowed failures by doing more of the build steps out of the guarded loop (that only detects junit failures, not others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition the patch, need to create and &quot;svn add&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
A contrib/wordnet/src/test&lt;br/&gt;
A contrib/similarity/src/test&lt;br/&gt;
A contrib/lucli/src/test&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes it possible to actually run the gdata-server tests, which were not running before. I have seen one case where it hung, but maybe that was a fluke.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                    <comment id="12502965" author="hossman" created="Sat, 9 Jun 2007 00:57:45 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;No worries Steven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the patch now, i&apos;m wondering if it&apos;s really worth adding the top level &quot;compile-test-contrib&quot; target, or if the top level &quot;build-contrib&quot; target should just take care of calling the compile-test target (and making test-contrib depend on build-contrib) ... it would be one less time we have to crawl the contribs, and the only &quot;downside&quot; is that there is no longer a way to build all contirbs without compiling the tests for each contrib as well ... is that really that bad?  is anyone building binary distributions without running the tests anyway? would those people really care if the build took a little longer because it compile the tests even though they weren&apos;t run?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="12502966" author="michaelbusch" created="Sat, 9 Jun 2007 01:18:16 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; would those people really care if the build took a little longer &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; because it compile the tests even though they weren&apos;t run? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO this is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; and since i&apos;m not certain these additional changes will make it &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; into the 2.2 branch (not my call to make)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is contrib stuff I would say it is ok to get it into&lt;br/&gt;
2.2 as long as we also fix the failing tests with this patch.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="12502982" author="hossman" created="Sat, 9 Jun 2007 02:48:21 +0100"  >
&lt;p&gt;1) rather then add empty src/test directories to contribs (which might confuse people: they might assume tests exist by seeing the dir, they might assume they didn&apos;t get the tests in their release since the dir is empty, they might svn remove the dirs not realizing it will break the build, etc...) i made the contrib-build.xml skip the compile-test and test targets if there are no tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Encountered a problem while testing the patch:  tests in some contribs rely on the core tests files (spellchecker depends on the English class for example) and &quot;ant clean test-contrib&quot; doesn&apos;t ensure that the core tests are compiled  (because build-contrib no longer depends on compile-test).  I view this is really a problem with the way contrib dependencies are built and not the main build.xml ... on a clean checkout you should be able to do &quot;cd contrib/foo; ant test&quot; and have it automatically build all your dependencies (this already works for the core lucene jar because of the &quot;build-lucene&quot; task).  so I made some additions to contrib-build.xml to support this (a &quot;build-lucene-test&quot; task), and the spellchecker contrib that needed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) with Michael&apos;s encouragement, i went ahead and removed the &quot;compile-test-contrib&quot; target and just made &quot;build-contrib&quot; take care of it ... this involved adding a new &quot;build-jar-and-tests&quot; since contrib-crawl/subant only support a single target name ... this is much cleaner in my opinion then the old way where build-contrib would just run whatever the &apos;default&apos; target was for each contrib (which could be named anything, and could do anything) .. now the expected semantics are clearer  (although i&apos;m open torenaming the target)&lt;br/&gt;
...but i ran into a slight snag because of the &quot;javacc-uptodate-check&quot; init depends on which doesn&apos;t work for &quot;meta-contribs&quot; like gdata and db that don&apos;t have a src dir ... the task even has a TODO that it really only needs to be done for a few contribs, so that looks like a good thing to fix to ... but i&apos;ve got to run now.  i&apos;ll try to update the patch a little later tonight (any feedback in the meantime would be appreciated)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ok, i am 99% sure this patch is &lt;b&gt;GOLDEN&lt;/b&gt;  ... it should take care of everything Steven pointed out, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this this patch does...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High Level...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&quot;build-contrib&quot; now calls a new &quot;build-artifacts-and-tests&quot; target&lt;br/&gt;
  on every contrib (previously it just called the default target)&lt;br/&gt;
  ... any failures in any contrib fail the build.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&quot;test-contrib&quot; now depends on &quot;build-contrib&quot; ... along with the&lt;br/&gt;
  previous point, this solves addresses the crux of the issue Steven&lt;br/&gt;
  noticed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;By default, the compile-test and test targets of contribs without&lt;br/&gt;
  tests do nothing (previously they failed because of a missing directory)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;cleanup of the build files for various contribs so that various&lt;br/&gt;
  dependencies work better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Details...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;changes to contrib-build.xml...&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;add a build-artifacts-and-tests target&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;better support for &quot;build-lucene&quot; (executed in proper directory&lt;br/&gt;
    now)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;new support for &quot;build-lucene-tests&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;test and compile-test now do nothing if the contrib has no tests&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;changes to gdata-server build.xml...&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;test now depends on compile-test&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;added build-artifacts-and-tests (because it can&apos;t import&lt;br/&gt;
    contrib-build.xml)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;adds explicit compile-core, compile-test, and&lt;br/&gt;
  build-artifacts-and-tests targets to the db build.xml (meta-contrib&lt;br/&gt;
  can&apos;t use the ones inherited from contrib-build.xml)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;clean up the bdb, bdb-je, and benchmark build.xml files so their&lt;br/&gt;
  init targets depend on the contrib-build init target (and doesn&apos;t&lt;br/&gt;
  skip up to common.init)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;change spellchecker build.xml so it&apos;s compile-test depends on&lt;br/&gt;
  build-lucene-test (it compiles against English.java)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;main build.xml ...&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;build-contrib now contrib-crawls build-artifacts-and-tests&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;test-contrib depends on build-contrib&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll try to do some more testing of various build target permutations tomorrow &amp;#8211; particularly under java 1.4 &amp;#8211; but i&apos;d appreciate it if other people could try beating on it as well&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I tried the new patch out on Windows and Linux, JDK 1.5. I ran different target combinations - it always finished successful. Will review the patch itself tomorrow (am a bit too tired now...). Thank you for taking care of all these build issues, Hoss!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
