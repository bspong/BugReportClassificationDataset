            <title>[HTTPCLIENT-213] Authentication fails with proxied SSL Connections</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-213</link>
                <project id="12310360" key="HTTPCLIENT">HttpComponents HttpClient</project>
                        <description>When connecting through a proxy, using SSL and authentication HttpClient winds &lt;br/&gt;
up sending a GET request to the proxy after the initial auth required response, &lt;br/&gt;
the proxy then obviously responds with a not implemented response since it &lt;br/&gt;
can&amp;#39;t handle a GET request to an SSL URL.  In essence the following is &lt;br/&gt;
happening:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
1. HttpClient sends Connect response.&lt;br/&gt;
2. Proxy responds 200 Connect OK&lt;br/&gt;
3. HttpClient uses SSL connection to send the request to the web server.&lt;br/&gt;
4. Web server responds with not authorized and closes the connection.&lt;br/&gt;
5. HttpClient opens a new connection to the proxy and issues a GET request for &lt;br/&gt;
the SSL URL.&lt;br/&gt;
6. Proxy returns 501 not implemented.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll attach a full log to this bug.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is likely to be hard to fix since the retry is performed in HttpMethodBase &lt;br/&gt;
but the Connect method is executed by HttpClient so a fix for this may be best &lt;br/&gt;
waiting for 2.1.  This looks very similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-195&quot; title=&quot;NTLM authentication failed due to closing of connection&quot;&gt;&lt;strike&gt;HTTPCLIENT-195&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/a&gt; except that that bug is &lt;br/&gt;
marked as fixed and this one still doesn&amp;#39;t work, this also applies to &lt;br/&gt;
authentication schemes other than NTLM (testing NTLM and basic).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
My best evaluation is that the web server returns Connection: close when it &lt;br/&gt;
rejects the authorization attempt and then HttpMethodBase is incapable of &lt;br/&gt;
creating a new SSL connection through the proxy.  The only thing I can think of &lt;br/&gt;
that could be done prior to 2.1 to fix this is to send a Connection: keep-alive &lt;br/&gt;
as well as the Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive we&amp;#39;re already sending with the &lt;br/&gt;
original request.</description>

afraid this one will have to wait till 2.1. Redirects and authentication logic&lt;br/&gt;
must be pulled out of the HttpMethodBase class and moved into HttpClient class&lt;br/&gt;
in order to work properly. HttpMethodBase class refactoring will solve a whole&lt;br/&gt;
bunch of other problems, not only this one.&lt;br/&gt;

I know there are architectural problems. But had this not worked before (I guess&lt;br/&gt;
the problem does not show up with every server)? I mean it is a basic feature&lt;br/&gt;
that is broken! We just can not release HttpClient 2.0 known that it is broken,&lt;br/&gt;
can we?</comment>

so it is worse than before).  Previously it just appeared as one of the &lt;br/&gt;
IOExceptions that were thrown by HttpClient a lot, all of these have now been &lt;br/&gt;
fixed so the problem comes through as it initially was.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In addition, back around December, HttpClient couldn&amp;#39;t connect to SSL URLs &lt;br/&gt;
through a proxy at all (there was no connect method) so this is really just &lt;br/&gt;
incomplete support for a new feature.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I should also note that you can work around this issue if you &lt;br/&gt;
setDoAuthentication(false) then manage authentication yourself.</comment>

It could have never worked and never did. The problem is the retry logic is &lt;br/&gt;
implemented inside HttpMethodBase, whereas Connect method is executed outside &lt;br/&gt;
it and therefore can&amp;#39;t be retried. There&amp;#x92;s no way we can fix it reliably &lt;br/&gt;
without ripping the whole thing apart. If you recall I was fighting really hard &lt;br/&gt;
to get this problem fixed back in February, but my patch was turned down &lt;br/&gt;
(delayed, postponed, whatever). It would be kind of ironic to start the whole &lt;br/&gt;
story over after we have just all voted for API freeze.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
As already noted, the problem is with the retry logic and it&amp;#39;s location.  This problem can only be &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot; in the current architecture by not allowing retries on tunneled connections that have been &lt;br/&gt;
closed.  This would force the user to handle the 401 response and retry.  We could accomplish this &lt;br/&gt;
with a little extra logic in the methodRetryHandler or in execute().  This really does not solve the &lt;br/&gt;
problem though, it just keeps HttpMethodBase for trying to connect to the proxy server.&lt;br/&gt;

However, that would not solve the problem of multiple authentication attempts&lt;br/&gt;
via a tunneled connection. Preemptive authentication still appears the only&lt;br/&gt;
feasible workaround [sigh].&lt;br/&gt;
