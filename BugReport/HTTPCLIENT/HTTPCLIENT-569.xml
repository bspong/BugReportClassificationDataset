            <title>[HTTPCLIENT-569] HttpState.clearCookies() should be synchronized</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-569</link>
                <project id="12310360" key="HTTPCLIENT">HttpComponents HttpClient</project>
                        <description>The HttpState class has a clearCookies method that is not synchronized but&lt;br/&gt;
should be considering it modifies an ArrayList (which is unsynchronized). All&lt;br/&gt;
other methods which modify or read from the ArrayList are synchronized except&lt;br/&gt;
the clearCookies method. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I stumbled upon this fact because a webapp I am working on that uses HttpClient&lt;br/&gt;
threw an IllegalArgumentException indicating that one of the cookies in the&lt;br/&gt;
array returned from HttpState.getCookies() was null, which shouldn&amp;#39;t be&lt;br/&gt;
possible.  Upon further inspection and testing, the only possible option is that&lt;br/&gt;
the threadsafety hole left by the unsynchronized clearCookies method caused the&lt;br/&gt;
issue.</description>

Test case source code&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The attached source code is what I used to confirm that there could be a&lt;br/&gt;
problem with the clearCookies method.  Every time I run it I get a null Cookie&lt;br/&gt;
after just a second or two.  Sure, it&amp;#39;s contrived, but it is more of a proof of&lt;br/&gt;
concept than anything.</comment>

&lt;br/&gt;
However it seems awkward to me why you wanted to clear cookies from a different&lt;br/&gt;
thread in the middle of other requests executing. Even if there is now no&lt;br/&gt;
exception thrown anymore HttpClient&amp;#39;s behaviour is certainly not deterministic&lt;br/&gt;
in that case.</comment>

&amp;gt; This is clearly a bug.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; However it seems awkward to me why you wanted to clear cookies from a different&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; thread in the middle of other requests executing. Even if there is now no&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; exception thrown anymore HttpClient&amp;#39;s behaviour is certainly not deterministic&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; in that case.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Agreed. When I saw someone else&amp;#39;s code using the same HttpState object across&lt;br/&gt;
multiple threads, I immediately changed the code to use only one HttpState per&lt;br/&gt;
thread. Yes, their code was not written with threadsafety in mind, but&lt;br/&gt;
fortunately I was able to find that person&amp;#39;s problem AND this bug and be part of&lt;br/&gt;
the solution for both.</comment>
