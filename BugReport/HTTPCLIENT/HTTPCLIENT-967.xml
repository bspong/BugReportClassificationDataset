            <title>[HTTPCLIENT-967] allow cache to be configured as a non-shared (private) cache</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-967</link>
                <project id="12310360" key="HTTPCLIENT">HttpComponents HttpClient</project>
                        <description>Currently the CachingHttpClient only behaves as a shared cache, which is a safe and conservative assumption. However, in some settings, it would be appropriate to be able to configure the CachingHttpClient as a non-shared cache, which would make more responses cacheable, including:&lt;br/&gt;
* responses to requests with Authorization headers&lt;br/&gt;
* responses with &amp;#39;Cache-Control: private&amp;#39;&lt;br/&gt;
* ability to serve stale responses when invalidation fails for &amp;#39;Cache-Control: proxy-revalidate&amp;#39;&lt;br/&gt;

                    <comment id="12893225" author="cimjmoore" created="Wed, 28 Jul 2010 17:07:44 +0100"  >I have attached a patch to address this issue. Please note that this patch also includes the HttpParams-style configuration patch that was posted for issue 972:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-972&quot;&gt;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-972&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
(If you need me to rebuild this because you have already applied said patch for issue 972, I&amp;#39;m happy to do so).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Major changes in this patch are to extract an AbstractProtocolTest superclass from TestProtocolRequirements, so that we can inherit from this for a new test class, TestProtocolAllowedBehavior (i.e. things where the HTTP/1.1 spec says we MAY do something). All MUST requirements currently under test still pass, but now we cache responses for the items mentioned in this issue if we are a non-shared (private) cache.&lt;br/&gt;

That&amp;#39;s the only difference between this patch and the previous one.&lt;br/&gt;
