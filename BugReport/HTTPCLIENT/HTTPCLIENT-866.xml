            <title>[HTTPCLIENT-866] HttpClient depends on jcip-annotations.jar</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-866</link>
                <project id="12310360" key="HTTPCLIENT">HttpComponents HttpClient</project>
                        <description>When using Java 5 to compile code that uses HttpClient, jcip-annotations.jar must be in the classpath or else you get a compiler error:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[javac] /path/to/src/SomeFile.java:129: cannot access net.jcip.annotations.GuardedBy&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[javac] file net/jcip/annotations/GuardedBy.class not found&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[javac]         DefaultHttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[javac]                                        ^&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
With Java 6, you get a bunch of warnings instead.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[javac] org/apache/http/impl/client/AbstractHttpClient.class(org/apache/http/impl/client:AbstractHttpClient.class): warning: Cannot find annotation method &amp;#39;value()&amp;#39; in type &amp;#39;net.jcip.annotations.GuardedBy&amp;#39;: class file for net.jcip.annotations.GuardedBy not found&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This requirement doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be documented anywhere, and jcip-annotations.jar is not included in the &amp;quot;httpcomponents-client-4.0-bin-with-dependencies&amp;quot; package.&lt;br/&gt;

When using Maven to build HttpClient all requisite dependencies are obtained automatically from a central repository. &lt;br/&gt;

jcip-annotations are not required at the run time and therefore the jar is not shipped with the &amp;quot;httpcomponents-client-4.0-bin-with-dependencies&amp;quot; package. &lt;br/&gt;

If you use Java 5 and HttpClient, you need the JCIP annotation jar in your classpath at compile time. Try it :-) Presumably this is because those annotations have runtime retention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I think it would be ideal if consumers of HttpClient didn&amp;#39;t need this jar. Second best would be to include it in the HttpClient distribution.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
I think the retention policy of jcip-annotations.jar is set to RUNTIME in order to enable automated detection of concurrency related bugs using some kind runtime analysis tools. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Sebastian&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Unless we can find a way to override the retention policy of jcip-annotations.jar to SOURCE at least for official builds of HttpClient and HttpCore, we should seriously consider removing dependency on jcip-annotations.jar. Alternatively, we should consider the possibility of forking  jcip-annotations provided its licence is compatible with ASFv2&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Using Java 1.5.0_18 generates errors for the missing annotations.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Whereas using Java 1.6.0_14 generates warnings for the missing annotations.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Looks like this is at least partly a compiler issue.</comment>

&lt;br/&gt;
Sebastian, but when jcip-annotations.jar was brought in, the whole idea was it was not going to impact the runtime behaviour of HttpClient. This is clearly not the case now. At the very least HttpCore should not have it as a dependency.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
However, it&amp;#39;s likely to be a lot of work to fix the runtime dependency, so it may be useful to explore other options at least in the short-term.</comment>

&lt;br/&gt;
(1) I am going to remove jcip-annotations.jar as a dependency for HttpCore as it is currently not being used anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;
(2) As far as HttpClient is concerned I see three options&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;a) remove jcip annotations altogether&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;b) replace jcip annotations with similar ones with SOURCE retention and provide a script to convert annotations back to jcip&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;c) make jcip annotations runtime dependency&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Which options would you prefer?&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
2) I prefer (b) then (c) then (a)&lt;br/&gt;
If we do go for (a), then I suggest commenting the annotations rather than removing them, as the comments would still be useful.</comment>

&lt;br/&gt;
If we add annotations as part of HttpClient, then it may be hard to add them to HttpCore later without causing problems.&lt;br/&gt;
I think the annotations would need to go in a separate module, this might make it possible to move them to HttpCore later.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;m beginning to think it might be easier to comment out the annotations for now.</comment>

I suppose nothing&lt;br/&gt;

&amp;gt; Won&amp;#39;t it cause a problem to have two copies of the classes? &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As long as those classes are identical it does not matter what jar they come from. It is like having any jar on the same classpath twice.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
If we have to add this [1] to every NOTICE and LICENSE file in every assembly and jar of HttpClient I am beginning to have doubts it is worth the trouble. For instance, NOTICE and LICENSE resources in jars get automatically generated by Maven remote-resources plugin for us, which is quite convenient. At the very least we would have to maintain our own resource bundle for HttpClient, which seems a bit too much, given the current project composition.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
How about just replacing JCIP annotations with comments until there is a version of JCIP annotations maintained by ASF?&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
We either have to go back to maintaining a separate copy of L&amp;amp;N filers per jar and assembly (that makes 4 for client and 4 for core) or maintain a separate resource bundle for HC projects. Given there is only two of us maintaining the code on more or less regular basis, the additional effort required seems too much. The process of cutting official releases is already painful and frustrating enough. &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Ideally, the name in the NOTICE file should include the subcomponent (i.e. Client/Mime) but it would not be wrong to use &amp;quot;Apache HttpComponents Client&amp;quot; for both Client and Mime. In which case, the same N&amp;amp;L files can be used for the whole of HttpClient.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The process that generates the NOTICE file needs to be fixed anyway, because it is currently broken.</comment>

However, I think the RetentionPolicy should probably be CLASS (i.e. the default), not SOURCE. &lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve tried compiling with this and Sun Java does not complain.&lt;br/&gt;
Using CLASS retention would mean that the annotation should be available to tools that process class files.</comment>

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Revert HttpClient pom.xml version change&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Maybe when 4.0.1 is released, it will work&lt;br/&gt;
on Java 1.5.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Wouldn&amp;#39;t it make sense to remove HttpComponents&amp;#39; internal copies of these classes, which was a work-around, and instead depend on this JAR?</comment>
