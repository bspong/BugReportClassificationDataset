                        <description>HttpClient requires a way of allowing a SOCKS proxy to be used on some&lt;br/&gt;
connections without requiring that all created Sockets go through the proxy.</description>

a customized version of HttpClient for the indefinite future, so it doesn&amp;#39;t &lt;br/&gt;
much matter where it goes in the official version.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Storing the SOCKS info in HostConfiguration was more because we consider a &lt;br/&gt;
SOCKS proxy to be on the same footing as an HTTP Proxy (in the sense that &lt;br/&gt;
they&amp;#39;re both proxies), and HTTP proxy was stored in HostConfig.</comment>

to HostConfiguration at all, as one would very rarely need to change proxy on a&lt;br/&gt;
per host basis. In the overwhelming majority of cases there&amp;#39;s only one proxy the&lt;br/&gt;
user would want to deal with. So, I&amp;#39;d rather see proxy settings moved to&lt;br/&gt;
HttpParams, but that would be too radical for 3.0. &lt;br/&gt;

There can be times where traffic on one NIC will require use a a proxy where &lt;br/&gt;
traffic directed through another will not.</comment>

&lt;br/&gt;
Proxy settings are &amp;#39;manual routing&amp;#39; on the application layer of the protocol&lt;br/&gt;
stack. Therefore proxy settings must remain a per host property in any case.&lt;br/&gt;
Even if most proxy users will only use one proxy setting for all their&lt;br/&gt;
connections, we must not restrict HttpClient to this most common case. I think&lt;br/&gt;
it is an essential flexibility to be able to use a specific proxy per connection.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At our company for instance, we have access to the intranets of some of our&lt;br/&gt;
clients. It makes sense to set up one proxy server for each of those&lt;br/&gt;
connections. With HttpClient I can then access any host in those intranets&lt;br/&gt;
depending on the proxy setting.&lt;br/&gt;
Also, if we ever want to implement PAC (auto config) we need to be able to use&lt;br/&gt;
one setting per host.</comment>

settings, as HostConfiguration is getting a little too messy IMO. I am not&lt;br/&gt;
trying to say that we should not support multiple proxies and different proxy&lt;br/&gt;
types. Let&amp;#39;s just consider leveraging HttpParams as it has been specifically&lt;br/&gt;
designed to  allow parameter settings at client | method | connection level&lt;br/&gt;

I think that&amp;#39;s enough to address this requirement by plugging in a custom CCO.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
HttpRoute does not make provisions for representing socks proxies. They could be inserted into the route as a proxy with socks: protocol, to make the connection manager socks-aware. That would throw off a lot of the upper layers though.&lt;br/&gt;
Another way to represent the socks proxy in the route would be as the &amp;quot;local address&amp;quot;. That should not cause problems in the upper layers, you just can&amp;#39;t combine socks proxies and actual local addresses that way.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
cheers,&lt;br/&gt;
