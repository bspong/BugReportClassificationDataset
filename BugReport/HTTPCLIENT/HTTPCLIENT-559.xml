            <title>[HTTPCLIENT-559] SSL contrib files do not use standard javax.net.ssl package provided from JDK 1.4.2</title>

                        <description>Hi all,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
While trying to use ssl on AIX, i found that some of the files contributed in &lt;br/&gt;
src/contrib/org/apache/commons/httpclient/contrib/ssl were making hard &lt;br/&gt;
references to com.sun.net.ssl package. Since JDK 1.4.2, one shall use the &lt;br/&gt;
javax.net.ssl package instead.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I have then:&lt;br/&gt;
1/ fixed the source files appropriately&lt;br/&gt;
2/ updated the build.xml to also build a commons-http-client-contrib.jar &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I will attached to this bug report the resulting unified diff to include in svn</description>

HttpClient 3.0 needs to be Java 1.2.2 compatible. It cannot use Java 1.4&lt;br/&gt;
specific interfaces. One of the reasons why all these classes are in the contrib&lt;br/&gt;
package is that they ought not to be used without customization. This is also a&lt;br/&gt;
reason why we do not distribute the contrib code in a form of a jar package&lt;br/&gt;

downloaded from sun, my patch will work since it provides the javax.net.ssl &lt;br/&gt;
packages.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Moreover, if you look at the StrictSSLProtocolSocketFactory.java code, you &lt;br/&gt;
will se it is already using the javax.net.ssl framework.&lt;br/&gt;

&amp;gt; I understand the portability issue but if you use a JDK 1.2.2 with JSSE &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; downloaded from sun, my patch will work since it provides the javax.net.ssl &lt;br/&gt;

&amp;gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
No, it will not. Please correct me if I am wrong, but&lt;br/&gt;
javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager class, for instance, is not available in the JSSE&lt;br/&gt;
1.0.3 &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
I would then at least expect http common project to provide:&lt;br/&gt;
- a copy of the files to be used with old JSSE&lt;br/&gt;
- another copy fully portable across JDK &amp;gt;= 14 and recommended for such JDKs&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At least, people would use the portable version for new projects instead of &lt;br/&gt;
keeping forever SUN hard references. This is also motivated by the fact that &lt;br/&gt;
SUN announces the end of life for JSSE 1.0.3_xxx within the next two months:&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;JSSE 1.0.3_xx will EOL March 30, 2006, in alignment with J2SE 1.3.1.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
(extract from &lt;a href=&quot;http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/index-103.html)&quot;&gt;http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/index-103.html)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

(1) HttpClient 3.0 requires Java 1.2.2 compile-time compatibility. Period. End&lt;br/&gt;
of story. &lt;br/&gt;
(2) Artifacts in the &amp;#39;contrib&amp;#39; package are distributed as reference material&lt;br/&gt;
only and may not be fit for use in production without customization. They for&lt;br/&gt;
this reason are _NOT_ a part of the offical HttpClient distribution. Period. End&lt;br/&gt;
of story.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
HttpClient 4.0 will require JRE 1.4. This will enable us to remove Sun JRE&lt;br/&gt;
specific code from the contrib package.&lt;br/&gt;

understand why you do not want to at least provide the patches under a &lt;br/&gt;
ssl.jdk14 directory (under contrib). This will hurt noone and people will &lt;br/&gt;
decide which one they will use as base code for their project (they will at &lt;br/&gt;
least know there is a SUN reference there).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Anyhow, i just wanted to submit back a solution to a the pb i found: if you &lt;br/&gt;
don&amp;#39;t feel it may be of interest for others, feel free to discard the patches &lt;br/&gt;
attached.&lt;br/&gt;

&amp;gt; Since stuff in contrib isn&amp;#39;t production code and not part of the core, I don&amp;#39;t &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; understand why you do not want to at least provide the patches under a &lt;br/&gt;

&amp;gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Give me a _single_ reason why I should maintain _TWO_ versions of the same&lt;br/&gt;
stuff? I seriously doubt you will stick around to maintain this code.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If want to make a real contribution, feel free to pick up any of the bug reports&lt;br/&gt;
targeted for 3.1 release and run with it. This will be highly appreciated.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Alternatively consider posting your patches to the HttpClient user list. This&lt;br/&gt;
way your patches will end up in the mail archive and the code you wrote will be&lt;br/&gt;
made accessible to those who search the archives for a solution to similar problems.&lt;br/&gt;

Anyhow, giving up. This is useless to discuss this way.</comment>
