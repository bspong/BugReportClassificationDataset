MD5-sess patch + unit tests (and having run unit tests)&lt;br/&gt;

                    <comment id="12380935" author="dustin@spy.net" created="Fri, 5 Sep 2003 03:02:31 +0100"  >Hey, thanks for the pointers.  It was pretty late when I did this and I&lt;br/&gt;
completely guessed about how you&amp;#39;d want this.  I attached a new patch without&lt;br/&gt;
tabs and with the junit test.  Having run the junit test, I found something else&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;d broken in the digest stuff (assuming algorithm would be passed in, which is&lt;br/&gt;
not required).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;m completely comfortable with the unit tests, however, as they&lt;br/&gt;
only  seem to test that the authenticator and the digest get the same result,&lt;br/&gt;
not that the result is correct.  It would probably be a good idea to do a&lt;br/&gt;
similar set of digest tests that include an expected digest response to validate&lt;br/&gt;
the algorithms as well.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
That said, it&amp;#39;s lunch time.  :)&lt;br/&gt;

the patch should be applied to HEAD only or to 2.0 branch and HEAD. Opinions?&lt;br/&gt;

committing to the 2.0 branch. Well, we can now argue about the definition of the&lt;br/&gt;
term &amp;#39;feature&amp;#39; :-) But in this particular case I guess it&amp;#39;s okay to commit it to&lt;br/&gt;
the branch, as it adds improved compatibility, it&amp;#39;s small and has a test case.&lt;br/&gt;
Any objections?</comment>

what got me looking in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The server I was accessing was trying to negotiate the MD5-sess algorithm which&lt;br/&gt;
was silently ignored and the client responded with an MD5 algorithm which caused&lt;br/&gt;
a ``Bad request&amp;#39;&amp;#39; response from the server.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;d suggest that if this does not go into 2.0, that 2.0 at least log a warning&lt;br/&gt;
when the algorithm is not MD5.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Handling of the qop Parameter is fishy. qop can be &amp;quot;auth&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;auth-int&amp;quot; or&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;auth,auth-int&amp;quot; or not present.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The patch does not support auth-int at all.&lt;br/&gt;
Moreover it removes support for the case where qop is not present.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I will try and add adequate auth-int support while supporting the non-present&lt;br/&gt;
qop case as well. Test cases will follow.&lt;br/&gt;

provided.  Other than that, it&amp;#39;s the original implementation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I admit that I did not add support for the other two qop methods as I don&amp;#39;t have anything against &lt;br/&gt;
which I could confidentally test, however, I believe this patch only adds functionality and does not &lt;br/&gt;
remove any.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong.</comment>
                    <comment id="12380944" author="oglueck" created="Thu, 11 Sep 2003 16:57:31 +0100"  >Agreed, it&amp;#39;s not your &amp;#39;fault&amp;#39;. But the original implementation is bad!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
auth-int can not be implemented at this time since this would require access to&lt;br/&gt;
the request body (or a precalculated MD5-sum of it).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I will check your patch in and refactor the code afterwards. Also the tests need&lt;br/&gt;
reworking.</comment>
