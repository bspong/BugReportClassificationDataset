&lt;br/&gt;
If I&amp;#39;m reading the code correctly I believe the part about being cautious when using preemptive &lt;br/&gt;
authentication (PA) is not warranted.  If the host name is specified when setting the credentials, the &lt;br/&gt;
credentials will only used for authentication with that host.  They will not be added when &lt;br/&gt;
communicating with other hosts.  The only piece of info that&amp;#39;s missing when using PA is the realm.  In &lt;br/&gt;
particular I&amp;#39;m looking at HttpAuthenticator line 166.&lt;br/&gt;

I see three possibilities for the default credentials end up sent to untrusted&lt;br/&gt;
web  application:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
(1) when credentials are set for null host and null realm. We should have never&lt;br/&gt;
allowed that in the very first place, but we did, and now we have to live with&lt;br/&gt;
that. I believe at the very least we should warn the users about security&lt;br/&gt;
implications of setting default credentials for null host and realm&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
(2) HttpClient 2.0 does not take target port into consideration when selecting&lt;br/&gt;
credentials for the HTTP state. This also should have not have happened, but it&lt;br/&gt;
did. So, even if default credentials are set for a specific host, HttpClient can&lt;br/&gt;
send them to a untrusted application if it is hosted on a different port &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
(3) I believe there are at least several web platforms capable of supporting&lt;br/&gt;
different authentication realms defined within the same virtual host. There&amp;#39;s no&lt;br/&gt;
way HttpClient can differentiate those realms unless it receives an&lt;br/&gt;
authorization challenge. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
2 and 3 are really fringe cases but they are not impossible. Think of a hosting&lt;br/&gt;
company serving massive number of virtual sites off the same web platform&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I do admit that the part about being cautious when using preemptive may be badly&lt;br/&gt;
worded, but I do think it should be there&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&amp;gt; implications of setting default credentials for null host and realm&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Completely agree.  Having null host and realm is of little practical use.  I think we should just document &lt;br/&gt;
it heavily and let people shoot themselves in the foot if they so choose.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; (2) HttpClient 2.0 does not take target port into consideration when selecting&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; credentials for the HTTP state. This also should have not have happened, but it&lt;br/&gt;

&amp;gt; send them to a untrusted application if it is hosted on a different port &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
True, but this applies to non-preemptive authentication as well.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; (3) I believe there are at least several web platforms capable of supporting&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; different authentication realms defined within the same virtual host. There&amp;#39;s no&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; way HttpClient can differentiate those realms unless it receives an&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; authorization challenge. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Agreed.  Preemptive authentication, as is currently stands, cannot be effectively used in this case.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; 2 and 3 are really fringe cases but they are not impossible. Think of a hosting&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; company serving massive number of virtual sites off the same web platform&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In this case we should be okay, since each virtual host can be differentiated by host name.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; I do admit that the part about being cautious when using preemptive may be badly&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; worded, but I do think it should be there&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Good, I think we&amp;#39;re in agreement then :)  We should keep some warnings about preemptive &lt;br/&gt;
authentication, but try to focus on the areas where it could be a potential problem in practice.  In my &lt;br/&gt;
opinion the only real issue is in regard to hosts with multiple realms.&lt;br/&gt;

last paragraph.   Here&amp;#39;s my suggestion:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Original Text - &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It is highly recommended to avoid setting credentials for any host and realm (&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;null&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; host &lt;br/&gt;
and &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;null&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; authentication realm) in productive applications. Use the least restrictive &lt;br/&gt;
credentials scope when debugging only.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Suggested Text -&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Setting credentials with &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;null&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; host and realm values is highly discouraged in production &lt;br/&gt;
applications.  Doing this will result in the credentials being sent for all authentication attempts (all &lt;br/&gt;
requests in the case of preemptive authentication).  Use of this setting should be limited to debugging &lt;br/&gt;
only.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
