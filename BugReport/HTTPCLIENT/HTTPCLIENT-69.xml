article would be brilliant but unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t know enough about it to&lt;br/&gt;
write one.  If you were to jot down some notes I could write up the doc from&lt;br/&gt;
them at least as a draft.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Mike, I took a look at your threading article and it looks good, a few&lt;br/&gt;
rephrasings may help and I&amp;#39;ll look into that tomorrow but I&amp;#39;m not enough of a&lt;br/&gt;
word smith to do much with it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not sure about some of the other changes in the patch though, most of it&lt;br/&gt;
looks like minor spelling adjustments etc, but there is one change to the&lt;br/&gt;
authentication article that I think is incorrect.  In the subsection &amp;quot;Preemtive&lt;br/&gt;
Authentication&amp;quot; your patch adds a note that preemptive authentication can be&lt;br/&gt;
enabled on a per method basis by calling: someMethod.setDoAuthentication(true);&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;however from what I can tell, setDoAuthentication controls whether or not&lt;br/&gt;
HttpClient tries to authenticate at all and doesn&amp;#39;t affect preemptive&lt;br/&gt;
authentication.  More relevant seems to be the method&lt;br/&gt;
HttpState.setAuthenticationPreemptive(boolean value).</comment>

&lt;br/&gt;
Any assistance on phrasing would be helpful.  Even though I wrote it, I find the&lt;br/&gt;
wording a little awkward.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You are quite right about preemptive authentication.  That part of the patch&lt;br/&gt;
should be removed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
I will happily provide most of the content for the SSL guide. Unfortunately it &lt;br/&gt;
may take me a while, though, as I am quite busy doing those unpleasant things &lt;br/&gt;
called earning a living. (The consulting business appears to be picking up a &lt;br/&gt;
bit here in Europe, and my bosses occasionally want me to get some stuff done &lt;br/&gt;
in return for keeping me on their payroll). I would really appreciate if could &lt;br/&gt;
just massage the article language- and style-wise, correct my Russki English &lt;br/&gt;
and make sure the content is actually readable and clear enough for an average &lt;br/&gt;
HttpClient user. I have a notoriously bad record of writing documentation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As far as preemptive authentication goes, it can be controlled on a per HTTP &lt;br/&gt;
state basis. The HttpState class reads the default value from &lt;br/&gt;
the &amp;#39;httpclient.authentication.preemtive&amp;#39; upon initialization. Once the &lt;br/&gt;
HttpState object is instantiated, the preemptive authentication can be &lt;br/&gt;
activated / deactivated with the following method:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
HttpState#setAuthenticationPreemtive(boolean)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

No objections from me. I think you should also re-tag the content of xdoc&lt;br/&gt;
directory after having committed the patches, as these changes should make it&lt;br/&gt;
into beta-1. &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
1. Quotes from user&amp;#39;s on why they used it (I&amp;#39;ll post under a new thread to the &lt;br/&gt;
mailing list calling for these soon).  Currently we have a list of &lt;br/&gt;
applications that used HttpClient but not why they did.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
2. Clover reports.  Clover is a commercial product that provides free licenses &lt;br/&gt;
for opensource projects upon request.  There was a discussion about how to go &lt;br/&gt;
about requesting this on commons-dev a while back but I&amp;#39;m not sure what the &lt;br/&gt;
outcome was (I don&amp;#39;t recall seeing one).  Should we contact the PMC for &lt;br/&gt;
approval or just go ahead and request a license?  I&amp;#39;d really like to get &lt;br/&gt;
Clover up and running so we can do a review of the test cases.</comment>
                    <comment id="12379487" author="olegk" created="Tue, 17 Jun 2003 16:54:39 +0100"  >Adrian,&lt;br/&gt;
I would just quickly consult the rest of the Commons crowd by posting a message&lt;br/&gt;
to the jakarta-commons-dev. If no satisfactory answer is given in a timely&lt;br/&gt;
manner, we should approach the vendor on our own. &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;a href=&apos;mailto:Community@apache.org&apos;&gt;Community@apache.org&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have anything to say on the matter so I&amp;#39;ve gone with the &lt;br/&gt;
historical approach of just requesting a license ourselves.  We should hear back from them in the &lt;br/&gt;
next day or so.  I&amp;#39;ve already received an email from their tech support saying they&amp;#39;d be happy to &lt;br/&gt;
provide a free license to HttpClient if I just filled out the appropriate form on the website.  Having &lt;br/&gt;
now filled out that form, I don&amp;#39;t expect there&amp;#39;ll be any issues.</comment>
                    <comment id="12379489" author="adrian@ephox.com" created="Thu, 26 Jun 2003 19:20:23 +0100"  >We now have a license for clover to use with HttpClient (HttpClient committers &lt;br/&gt;
can email me for details on how to get their hands on it).  To add the report &lt;br/&gt;
to the website we need to specify it as a report in the project.xml.  However, &lt;br/&gt;
it means that we have to specify every report we want to run so we won&amp;#39;t &lt;br/&gt;
automatically get any new reports that are added to maven&amp;#39;s default setup.  I &lt;br/&gt;
have listed all the reports we currently have in the project.xml.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Also, for clover to work, you must run the unit tests in a forked JVM as the &lt;br/&gt;
results are only written out when the JVM exits.  I&amp;#39;ve added the property that &lt;br/&gt;
achieves this to project.properties, but if you rebuild httpclient using maven &lt;br/&gt;
a lot during development, you may wish to override this in your own &lt;br/&gt;
build.properties (which takes precedence).  The line to add is:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
maven.junit.fork=false&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Also, the clover plugin seems to have major issues on Windows, particularly &lt;br/&gt;
when there is a space in the path to the HttpClient sources.  I&amp;#39;m not sure if &lt;br/&gt;
this has been fixed in maven&amp;#39;s CVS yet or not.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So, do considering these down sides, do we wish to add clover to maven&amp;#39;s &lt;br/&gt;
default run or should we:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
a. add a link to the report via navigation.xml and run the clover report &lt;br/&gt;
manually then upload it to the site.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
b. Not put the clover report on the website and just use it when required.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
c. Go find a fix for the problems and use an updated version of the clover &lt;br/&gt;
plugin when generating the site (what happens to anyone who is still using the &lt;br/&gt;
last stable release of maven or before?).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
d.  Something completely different.</comment>

Adrian&lt;br/&gt;
I apologize that your efforts to promote the use of clover have so far enjoyed&lt;br/&gt;
only a lukewarm support from our side. You have the right to feel abandoned. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I believe I have some explaining to do. I feel 100% test case coverage may be&lt;br/&gt;
simply unattainable at this point. Yes, it should be our goal, but it is not the&lt;br/&gt;
only goal that we have. I think your efforts can be better spent by looking into&lt;br/&gt;
SimpleHttpConnection redesign, for instance. I would feel by far better if had a&lt;br/&gt;
way to reliably test proxy support, instead of bringing up the formal test case&lt;br/&gt;
coverage level from 50% to 51%. So, I am perfectly comfortable with plan B (Not&lt;br/&gt;
put the clover report on the website and just use it when required) for the time&lt;br/&gt;
being.&lt;br/&gt;
